"ANMATY0L0HX6Y","3998899561","Sasha Malkin","[12, 16]","Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days. It doesn't heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn't wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can't even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don't know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I've made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays.

"A5A4374R8I7NB","6073894996","PWB Esq","[1, 1]","I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.","2.0","Works Fine, But It Died On ME","1340582400","06 25, 2012"

They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do.

So do have some replacements on hand. At this price, no problem.Yes, they work with both my iPhone and iPad. Also with every other USB device I've needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is very helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel.

Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!!

Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There's no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung.  Cord length and adapter style may vary as it seems like the seller is not consistent.","3.0","Works perfect; size and shape were different than expected.","1354579200","12 4, 2012"

The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm.

I literally took it out of the package, and the first time I pulled the cord out - didn't yank, tug, or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it. I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length.

By dual use, I mean, the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end. Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery. Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable...like this one, which is just fine...quality-wise and price-wise. Yep. Oh, and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall, whether your phone is plugged to it or not, so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep, you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light, because it is brighter then you may think.","5.0","Perfect for my T-Mobile Galaxy S2","1365120000","04 5, 2013"

I like the fact that they spin, come in a plastic kit. They are reasonably priced. These items are high quality. Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down. I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so... Nice case, nice color, small area, ... Comes in a card board cover as well. Packaged and more packaged. A little over doing it there. Can't be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case. Was going push up or down. Comes with different sizes. Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade.

Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed... all OFF and still drained.

The case is very good and labeled very clearly.

"AT65XR8QQLAFT","B00002X29G","Mr. Efficiency","[16, 18]","This review is for the iPhone 5 battery and tool set. I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other &#34;power users&#34; (i.e. slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery. After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery.

I loved that you get basically 6 ear gels in 3 sizes for both right and left error.I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise.The ear gels are gentle and fit in the ear.  Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset.  Also, while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get.But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I don't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear.

This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.","3.0","A good unit at a great price.  Worth a shot.","1107475200","02 4, 2005"

The car makes a lot of noise in any case, so I'm not holding out for audio lab quality. However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. I might have been able to tolerate that. However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok. I hadn't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long's to replace the Coby CA-747. The volume with the Maxell product was very weak, and I had to turn it way up. The Maxell didn't go click-click-click, but it whistled, too. So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me.

Wang jwangamazon","[12, 13]","I have been using this Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter for more than 2 years to use my car stereo to play audio of my DVD-player and CD-player. Until lately, my car tape player kept rejecting it out. I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again. While reading some other people's reviews, I bump into R. Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the skip mode as following:One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a skip mode. When a tape player's skip mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it hears sound again. If your tape player has a skip mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in normal play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to fast forward over any silent portions of your audio feed.This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the skip mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again. Very good product for the money.","5.0","Excellent product.","1151884800","07 3, 2006"

I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter.

The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly. Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in.  From this point just use your car's volume to amplify the volume.Good luck!","5.0","A giant eagle flew with all haste to deliver this package","1332720000","03 26, 2012"

This one works fantastic for the price. Sound quality is fine, about what you would expect from a cassette tape. The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically, which is great depending on your tape deck.The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use, it stopped working properly. My car's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson's review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this. I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple. Takes about 5 minutes, and I have no experience with this kind of thing whatsoever, so if I can do it, you can do it!","4.0","Great, and Easy to mod if your tape deck is auto-reverse","1301961600","04 5, 2011"

Most players you need to insert the cassette sideways, but I had some players before that you need to insert the cassette lengthwise. You will never go wrong with this adapter as you can feed it to your cassette player both ways.- Does not look cheap. It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20$- The coiled cord is great and much less clutter.  I had a cassette adapter that has a cord that was too long, it got caught under the seat and the only way to remove it is to cut it.- Sounds good too with my Ipod.Cons:- The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette.Bought this item twice already.","4.0","Just works!

Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again. It'll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in. Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell. pull on your device too quickly and it'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck.","2.0","Suuuuuccckkkkssssss","1386028800","12 3, 2013"

There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue...can't even hear it. The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good...(not sure it's even fair to compare).

The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.","5.0","Great Bluetooth Phone","1088899200","07 4, 2004"

It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer.  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).

"A3H3SG8XIXVKXZ","B0000ALPBP","Science Aardvark","[1, 1]","I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a universal adapter (micro-USB male to 2.5mm female). The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping). So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints.","4.0","non-identical twins","1303862400","04 27, 2011"

This Plantronics CS50 is simply the best unit I have ever used.  The unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office.  I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for. This device solved both problems.  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control.  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease.  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit.  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me.

The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.

"A2PRIQ2EA5GYML","B0000CEPC8","William M. Gibson","[1, 2]","I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it).  I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking talk me off speaker phone, and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a soft phone (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.

"A36R0XYHEWP2LA","B0000DYUZO","MW","[4, 4]","The product is okay but could be better. The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine. I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing.","3.0","Okay, but not great.","1320451200","11 5, 2011"

Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1. The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere. I was with AT&amp;T since they bought out L.A. Cellular. The customer service was great for years, but got so bad I?d wait on hold for hours and couldn?t get through to a person for days.","3.0","I love the phone but it has some real problems","1077148800","02 19, 2004"

Here's something that nobody told me before I bought it: You cannot use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC. You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity (this works for me) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc. does not work with Infrared. I've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this. When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable (read: shell out another $70) for that purpose.

FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely. I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really. Another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy.","4.0","Pretty good phone.. an improvement from my v205","1090627200","07 24, 2004"

A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function.  Cool.  So I ordered an i730 from Amazon.  After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number.  It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!?  That's over 700 miles away!  An 11 hour drive to the next state.  No way close to a local number.  Nextel did not seem to understand or care.  &quot;It's the closest we have.&quot;  &quot;There are no 602 area code phone numbers left.&quot;  I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix.  Nothing doing.  After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone.  I canceled the Nextel service.  They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.

I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.

I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since downgraded to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are Out of Service.Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone. Lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life. For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use.","3.0","Not a bad phone, but the cheaper model gets better signal.","1113523200","04 15, 2005"

(another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet.3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbers under different people's names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings. And it wasn't Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad.5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers.Overall, I don't like this phone at all. Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera.And, judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside), I don't think I want to own another Motorola product.

I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!  I'm going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength).  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.

Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone.  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways.-Decent battery life.  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.

I changed phones and service because my old phone could not get reception inside of buildings.  I chose the V300 due to the external antennae.  I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased.  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons.  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.

"A2AY4YUOX2N1BQ","B0001DVQNG","Ciaran","[1, 2]","A few months ago, Sabrent sent me several samples of car inverters to try out, and I have been pleased with all of them so far. This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price. Recommended for most, reservations for some.","4.0","Excellent but a little bulky.","1382832000","10 27, 2013"
"A1E1LEVQ9VQNK","B0001DVQNG","J. Chambers","[1, 1]","It's no problem charging mobile devices while you're driving, since these devices can be charged from a USB port, either built into the vehicle (newer models) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter). But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.","5.0","Extraordinarily useful and much less expensive than auto manufacturers' inverters","1379376000","09 17, 2013"

The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater, the way it blocks your whole ear canal.  But that's how it blocks out noise.  I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it.  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that.  It's sensitive equipment, with a filter in the earpiece that I know I'll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same, then it shouldn't be left in the open to collect dust.  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying.  You feel like you're hearing something under water, because the thing is so jammed in your ear (it's a little bit violating...).  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset.

I'm not talking about playing tennis here, I'm talking about driving the car, and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth.  The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.","3.0","Very good when it sits right","1268006400","03 8, 2010"
"AEAPGAG8DXQLT","B0001YX9ZI","Bruce_in_LA reader_in_LA","[0, 0]","As you can see by the picture, this device has merely an ear canal insert and the microphone and cord just dangle.  It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've pulled your ear back while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be, as someone reported, it's way better for wind noise, I haven't tried that.

I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn't sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It's light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place.

A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome.  The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they don't include an iPod/Blackberry/(some)Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, but I already have several.

I had hoped this Hub would actually work unlike the D-Link hub and it does the job great!I bought two and hooked one up to the PC and the other to the Mac and plugged 7 devices into each.  Everything worked and I did use the power just to make sure I could charge off of it if I wanted to.  This hub works perfect and the LED's look awesome.Very happy with this product and would buy same one if I needed another USB hub.  Of course I'm sure the 3.0 versions will soon start to proliferate but until then this is a great USB hub and priced well for what you get.","5.0","Good solid USB Hub!","1291248000","12 2, 2010"

In desperation, I bought a 4-port hub (working just fine, thank you), but I still did not have enough ports to do the job.  And the idea of daisy-chaining was not practical because my desk is already overloaded.Solution:Enter the CyberPower 7-port hub.  Space-saving solution to running out of ports.  And, with its own power supply, it's not draining power from my laptop.  Works like a charm!I did find the glow light annoying, but it's easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening, so it's not a big issue for me.I'm a happy camper now, and I whole-heartedly recommend this hub for those who need more ports in a small space.  I should also commend Amazon for super-fast delivery.  Problem solved!P.S.  Mikey is my cat.

Plug count/location is as follows:Along the left and right sides (3 per side) It has 6 USB female type A receptacles (this is the bigger USB connector you normally find on a PC)On the front near the bottom, there is a 7th USB type A receptacle  (at the bottom of the unit when it's in the stand) a USB mini type A receptacle (to connect the hub to the computer)and finally on the left side there's a power input for the external power supply.I've had this hub in use for almost a year now and it's held up very well to multiple plug/unplug cycles. The blue LED at the top is unnecessary to indicate power as there are the other green LEDs for each port. I've used the plugs for keyboards, mice, HDDs and thumb drives. I've never had any problems.Overall it a solid and small hub and recommended if all you need is USB 2.0 and up to 7 plugs.","4.0","Good 7 port USB 2.0 hub!","1397174400","04 11, 2014"
"A6FIAB28IS79","B000227PL8","Samuel Chell","[170, 176]","[Apart from minor issues like stability of the weighted base, this hub has been such a consistent, heavy-duty performer, while holding its price point (just short of 30) for exactly 4 years, that I've had to award it 5 stars (and order the identical model for my wife).  But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port in person, I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to fatten up the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest gripe: the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the cuteness factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This off brand hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington round mound have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]","5.0","4 years of flawless performance (I even bought another for my wife)--until now.","1200528000","01 17, 2008"
"A2HM2RMX1CBZGM","B000227PL8","Taylor Marsh DESOLATER IV","[0, 2]","For one, this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I'm not really sure...perhaps cheap components, and slight bending?Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub, it's a 2.0. Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future. For instance, my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed, because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time, and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won't stay on, especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily, it does not snap on, it's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it rests on top of. (Useless)- It glows neon Blue. Why? I'm not sure. I like it because it matches my setup, but it's very bright, and I'd rather the power be used towards the other devices.Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to not work entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device, and wasted my time trouble shooting. (just had to switch ports) In other words...don't buy this device...get a cheaper hub with more slots, or a 3.0 hub with more features.This is cheap...","1.0","Horrible Product....(after months of testing)","1353024000","11 16, 2012"

"A14EF1PPKMSEPU","B00022NE6I","E. Brown EB","[12, 16]","OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface. For example, the memory card is under the battery. The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while. This is representative of the entire phone operation. Not for the impatient.If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't. Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open. No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches. I've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that's subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'. It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.","4.0","High technology and lots of it w/a sluggish operation system","1110326400","03 9, 2005"

I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!","5.0","Everything A Phone Should Be..","1111190400","03 19, 2005"

The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90% of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model.  I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this Universal is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with Noise Cancelling.  It's about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don't like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.  This product is decently priced, but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.

"A1W5N8OT55A9Y3","B000246XQE","B. Christensen Frequent traveler, business o...","[9, 9]","The Pros:The function and design of this headset are first rate. Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying headset signal weak - switch to handset?The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is connected (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant crackling noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just disconnect the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The hanging design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.  I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes.  If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here.

The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery.

One with the Nokia 3650 (apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design. The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able). I also noticed that when I went around the corner, I would lose the signal. true for all units.All in all, I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5:Quality : jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-2.5Design: Jabra-5, Nokia-1, Motorola-1usabaility (range): Jabra-3, Nokia-3, Motorola-3usability (ease of use): Jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-3Overall: Jabra-4, Nokia-2, Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life.

While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.

I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.","4.0","Almost Excellent","1143849600","04 1, 2006"

Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15 Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I'm not sure I'd actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all, it's not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement.

There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a good headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks.

Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws.","2.0","try a better solution for your bluetooth headset needs","1120694400","07 7, 2005"

This is very small, but unlike the goldlatern bluetreks or the Jabra, does not hide its mass well; it all sits right outside your ear, and in completely inconspicuous.  With my old bluetrek and even the jabra, my hair hid most of it, which for me is a plus, as I do not use Bluetooth headsets to impress people or get atttention; I don't want peoples attention and questions.Which is this headsets only drawback - it has this HUGE, BLUE ORB-LIKE LIGHT on it that takes up the whole front of the piece.  YOU WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION with this headset on.  It blinks in standby, it blinks when in operation, it blinks all the dang time.  But, if you can get passed that, it does work pretty well.  The sound is a little tinny, but pretty clear.  And unlike all my other bluetooth headsets, the headset volume only operates the headset, and doesn't link to the phone volume - this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness, which is good.  The mic seems really good - no complaints from those on the other end, basically.  And the battery life isn't TOO ugly at 5 hours.  And the ear anchor could be a little more rigid and smaller for smaller ears, but it will do as long as you are not jogging around constantly.","4.0","Good performance, but expect stares...","1093305600","08 24, 2004"

But after installing it on my current device (Verizon XV6800 running Windows Mobile 6.1), I decided I liked it too much to sell. I forgot how much I liked this keyboard. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn't have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open, it's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings. If you are a slow typist, this is fine. But I'm a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type. Really irritating. I fixed this by making two little supports from stacked cardboard glued together. I stick these under the wings and that solves the problem.Here's where I got the latest driver released for the device (it's no longer supported by iGO):[...]This driver is for Windows Mobile 5, but it works on my Mobile 6.1 device. :)You MUST install the driver in MAIN MEMORY - not a storage card. If you install it on a storage card, it won't work.After I installed the driver, the configuration utility suggested that I upgrade the keyboard's firmware. I thought this wouldn't work since the keyboard is no longer supported by iGO, but to my surprise, it did - my firmware was updated from 1.1 to 1.2.The previous reviewer said he had to use the pointing stick to send email. That's because he didn't know the keyboard shortcut for Send: Alt-S.The keyboard folds up very small and compact and it's very light-weight - not a big deal to carry it around along with my SmartPhone.

You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it's new surroundings.  I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor....to boxing it up to send back when it wouldn't sync to my Axim x50v....to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly, I now love it again.  The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable.  It's great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it.

I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a universal device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words.","5.0","An excellent companion - - - far superior to IR keyboards.","1141257600","03 2, 2006"

My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I don't like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm doesn't shut off.

Messinger","[3, 3]","Originally created for use with Palm devices, the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for PDAs and Handhelds is still among the best folding, nearly full-sized Bluetooth keyboards available. Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called smart phones do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.","4.0","Still among the top folding Bluetooth keyboards available","1302480000","04 11, 2011"

This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard, with the same spring to the keys, quality, durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able, however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain, due to the fact that a) you have to use custom key commands using ctrl, fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer, you already know the motion for & or * or (), and you'll find yourself doing them! (meaning you are incorrect, on this keyboard)That said, entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard, just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it. You will get used to it, just like you got used to fast touch-typing.Anyhow, this thing is a gem for hammering out quick SMS text messages, etc. I mean no more click-click-click, clack-clack, click-click-click-click, clack-clack to type out a single four-letter word. Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men's pant pocket. I wear shorts, pants, etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent. I use this in class to quicly type out extensive class notes, as I can type far faster (and more legibly) than I can hand-write.The case is durable sandblasted aluminum (like my old minidisc player) and the detachable device stand is sweet! I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class, and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow, is this thing essential? I mean, I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in, say, a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can't draw graphs with this thing very well. However, for text-based notes in a college setting, this thing is well worth it. A smartphone as above and a keyboard, and you have one of THE major functions of a laptop, but without having to carry a laptop. Just the phone you'd have anyways, and this flat little thing.NOTE: if you have troubles reconnecting this thing, use the bluetooth connect on your phone first, then use the special driver provided by Think Outside to finish the connection. Two part process.In all, I am a college student and I wish I did not have to pay over $80 for this unit (why can't they make it for $30?), but in the end this thing is slightly sweeter than it's price, so it's worth it.","4.0","Wish it wasn't so expensive - but it's worth it","1161129600","10 18, 2006"
"A19RGDJPNZ7NZ","B0002OKCXE","MW","[3, 4]","I struggled with trying to get this thing to work with my Blackberry 8700g for some time.  I even selected and downloaded a driver that was listed for Blackberry devices on the product web site.  After a lot of frustration, I finally got my Blackberry to pair with the keyboard, but it would still not recognize it when I tried to get it to link to it.  I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that: Unfortunately, we do not have a driver for that device currently.  So, I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds.By the way, the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices, only with Smartphones.  A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate, in small letters, that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case, though, back it goes, which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.  In the mean time, I guess I'll keep looking.Lastly, I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit.

"A1N03V52IRZ5PR","B0002OKCXE","N. J. Simicich Gadget Geek","[2, 2]","It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail, while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price. Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple, easy to use, and works well. This is not a PC keyboard, and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard.

It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4x6 and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard, when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a techie by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.

Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.","4.0","Not bad, but stick to the original","1397779200","04 18, 2014"

No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad. Don't wear them to a job interview.","5.0","Great for the price","1389657600","01 14, 2014"

"A1ATWEANLT57YG","B0002SYC5O","Van Lam","[0, 0]","My LG HBS-730 that I use for bike rides with no problem.  Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don't know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.  I don't know if it's the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.  This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it.  I don't know if this is by design or just accident.  Either way, it's cool.","5.0","No interference at all","1403740800","06 26, 2014"
"A360VP3RBMJFDL","B0002SYC5O","Voyn238","[41, 41]","SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed.","5.0","The headset I've been waiting for! And YES, it does support the Apt-X codec.

The sound quality is low, especially outdoors, and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250.

The main reasons I chose this one were low price, small size/weight, and having seen a couple of people use this at work.Pros:The size/weight is so small as to be unnoticeable. I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise, it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent, probably 3+ days, although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can't use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great, sometimes 10 ft causes annoying I am about to disconnect noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything, it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing, last-number redial, etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally, the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone, look for something else.

Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain, and I have to believe them...It's weird though that I get always get a tingling, achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes. So try as I might, I cannot wear it for prolonged periods of time. After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging.

The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy, long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.

I got what I paid for. The sound quality and the mic quality are both decent, enough at least for someone who isn't obsessive about how crystal clear the reception is. It has a tendency to drop the connection sometimes for no apparent reason, annoying at times, but not very common.About a month after use, it stopped working for no explicit reason. I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola. However only a month or so after that, I seemed to have misplaced it, and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today, about a month and a half later, I found it, in my dryer. Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I hadn't washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle. Happy that I found it, but I all but gave up on it to work again. I gave it a shot anyway, and lo and behold, it did start charging. So after an hour I tried pairing it with my phone, and voila, IT STILL WORKS! I was stunned. Not only that a bluetooth headset could go through that abuse and still function like new, but a headset that seems relatively cheap and outdated!So based on my first experience it was a 2, but any piece of electronic equipment that can survive a wash and dry HAS to get two more stars in my book.

It's light, has good voice quality, louder earpiece volume than the phone itself (Mot V710) and the battery outlasts the phone.  A previous reviewer mentioned having to carry 2 chargers.

I love the headset but when I'm in an airport, it picks up the background noise as loudly as my voice.  If it was noise canceling it would have gotten 5 stars.  One last note: My phone doesn't ring when connected to the headset so you must have the headset on to know you have an incoming call.

I have to use a 2-way pager for work, and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager, I now just have this one small item.

I can use it not only for a wireless headset, but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still, unfortunately.  When I lock the keypad, I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up.  The menus are sometimes slow to respond, delaying as much as 2 full seconds (doesn't sound like much, but it can be irritating).Overall, I'd buy the phone again without hesitation, but I'm an early adopter.

No matter how carefully I used the button I ended up hitting the adjacent buttons too. I also had problems using the camera feature because of it's tiny size. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a bit of a klutz. I was also displeased to find that the unit's limited memory made any real web browsing impossible. Also, there appears to be no Bluetooth compatibility with Macs. It will sync with the use of a data cable ( a separate purchase required ), but I think it's a shame to spend the extra bucks for Bluetooth only to find it is of limited use.What made me decide to return the phone was that I found the signal to be weaker than any other cell I have ever owned. We live in a little valley that compromises the signal of any cell phone, but the A630 couldn't establish a solid connection.It's a great looking device and it feels very well built.

Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones, the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability, but T-Mobile just sucks big time, unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers.  Worse, their GPRS (data) network is slow and congested.  While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible, for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible.

T-Zones service is an inexpensive way to gain access to your POP3 email accounts. It has a keyboard. You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed. It is sloooo[...] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks. The most common email commands are buried in the menus, the least common commands occupy the prime spots. Someone didn't think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that's too much. They don't take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key, but you can't use it to delete a message. That's a waste. Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook? To issue a command, you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty, but because it's perfectly symmetrical, you can't tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can't dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset, you can dial by voice)So far, the battery doesn't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth, and who primarily talk or text, and who use POP3 occasionally, or not at all.","4.0","Good phone, minor flaws.

Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to press 1 for English, etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter A has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.","2.0","Awkward to use and unreliable","1109376000","02 26, 2005"

You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.","2.0","It's the service, stupid","1097020800","10 6, 2004"

I am a business user, not a Snoop Dog groupie, and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin, TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor, I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are OK but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year's contract with TMO in my book.

Simicich Gadget Geek","[16, 23]","I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can't always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser? - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called screen allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, [IMAGE], the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.","5.0","The Sidekick II does Almost everything....","1102896000","12 13, 2004"

Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn't the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between. And finally, finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover. Highly recommended.","5.0","Fantastic Screen Protector","1391644800","02 6, 2014"

The camera is terrible, which is pretty much true with all cell phones though, so that's a non unique gripe. The phone is also moderately fruity, like when you make or recieve calls, the outer LED will start blinking purple, blue, pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl, and the menus are all kind of childish.

I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 real pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few doodle type cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the hinge of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old blue versions of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new black face ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the flash when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said, that thing is huge!..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.  This is one of Verizon's best cell phones right now...highly recommended.","5.0","A great phone that deserves your attention","1100304000","11 13, 2004"

It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets, I can't say if it is the headset or the phone, but either way, if you buy one of these and have the same problem, make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well, but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent.

It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session!It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices, so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time, something cheap brand-X headsets don't do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger, perfect if you take your headset on the road. For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode sleep. When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there.

I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls, mostly from hotel rooms. This headset did not work out of the box for my situation. The Logitech support website was great. It said to upgrade the notebook's bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed, the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I've been experiencing too. I'm using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only, otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all, installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage, I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones. The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software. Thus I only gave it 4 stars. However, HP does sell stereo headphones (no microphone) for most IPaq models.Update: 15-March-2005 Am able to pair with Axim x50v PocketPc. Has considerable static.

I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine, I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to get off your crappy Jabra BT headset or take me off your Motorola BT headset.  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a correct way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.  I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world!","5.0","Great product!","1139529600","02 10, 2006"

This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building, so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations. A couple of key features:When a call comes in, either Intercom or from an external line, there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call. I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted, allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done, I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It's about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect. To get this to work properly, I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit. The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit. This was not explicitly stated in the install instructions. It took 10-15 minutes to figure out the trick. Once that was worked out however, everything has been perfect.The only thing that I cannot easily do is pick up parked calls as there is no function to select a line.

I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup.  I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.

Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge, in my opinion.

Had I not needed Bluetooth to work with my new Toyota Prius, I'd have stuck with the i500. In fact, if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 (SD memory slot, faster, etc.) I would have never considered the Treo 650.  So, let's talk about the positives of the 650:Camera w/movies is nice.  Memory card slot is nice.  It's fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great. Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites. Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on write on screen apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn't have to be trained.  Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2 and it does.  Call Bob Tompson Mobile and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers. VERY NICE.Battery life is so-so.  You have to charge it each day if you use the 'net much. i500 was poor, too, but better than this.  The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it!  (6035 and i500 had analog modes, too, while the 650 is digital only.)So, it's okay, I'm okay with it, it crashes/reboots randomly all the time, but ... there's really no other option on Sprint.I would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat...

It is a dramatic improvement and I love it.The screen is now high res and looks incredibly clear, the Bluetooth works wonderfully with the wireless Jabra headset. When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset. I don't particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep. Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras.  A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly, so far, it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications.  The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600. IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector. It requires a separate power supply to charge.  I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop.  This extra power connection is a messy annoyance.

But I do wish the Treo 600 can be better!I had the Treo 600 for almost 1 year and upgraded to Treo 650 as soon as PalmOne asked me to that's because Parts of my prayer has been answered: A better screen resolution; touch screen is more sensitive than the 600, I use my finger instead of the stylus now; camera is a lot clearer and the zoom works great; removable battery is really handy to use that fully charged spare one any time; my favorite bluetooth is built-in. And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.However, I am still looking for the built-in WiFi, and the bluetooth does not take voice command; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600. I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to. However, I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on. (Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this, so I heard.) With an SD card, I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed. And I was able to have about 18MB available internally.I like this new Treo 650, as to all my handheld gadgets, I bought a fitted case to protect it.

"A3QYIBMXQVLVE7","B0006FLA80","G. Crain","[66, 71]","I have had this phone almost 6 weeks (40 days).  At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a free return and repair, meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?  I know mine tries to; otherwise, we're out of business.","1.0","Sadly, I'm leaving Palm","1145491200","04 20, 2006"

I've always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought they aren't ready yet.  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It's not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.  Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you'd go for a week between recharges!It's only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped, but about as good as you can expect on such a small device.  It is definitely useable.  My instinct was to use my right thumb only, but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands (thumbs only) you'll be faster.From what I've seen of the Treo 600, I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600.  If you are waiting to make the jump into a combined PDA/phone, I believe thhis is a good point to do it.","4.0","I held off on PDA phones till now, but this one hooked me...","1107907200","02 9, 2005"

"AC4H6TDSOSLA3","B0006GFARG","gdinero","[4, 4]","Let me say up front that I ordered this from Amazon after reading all the glowing reviews, and I've been fairly disappointed by the performance I've experienced.  My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint's LG-PM325.First, the audio quality was not good.  If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.  Pairing was excellent.  The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably, and making or answering calls was straightforward.I've returned mine because of the two problems.","2.0","Performance Sub-Par","1121731200","07 19, 2005"

The Scala 500 is incredibly lightweight and (when adjusted properly to your ear) very comfortable.I'm impressed by the controls.  Both the main button and the volume 'wheel' are very accessible and very responsive.  With the Sony HBH35 headset I was constantly dropping calls due to the unresponsive controls.  This never happens with the Scala 500.  Additionally, volume is easily regulated.Pairing with the Motorola MPX220 phone was quick and easy.  Additionally, reconnect is quick and reliable following a disconnect due to powering off one of the units or going out of range.  (Range, by the way, is good; comparable with the HBH35 headset.)You can hear the other party clearly and crisply.  Transmission of your voice, I would say, is good.  Though there's infrequent interferrence (static) on voice transmission, I've never had anyone complain about difficulty in hearing/understanding me.  There's NO annoying bluetooth echo.To sum it up:Plusses:  Price, size, weight, comfort, pairing, controls, sound quality, range, responsive customer service.Negatives:  Requires charging cradle (one more thing to haul around if you're traveling), no 'fuel guage' to indicate battery life (red flash comes on, but only when it's close to dying)","4.0","Great Bluetooth Headset","1112918400","04 8, 2005"

My only complaint really is that the tone of voices on my end sounds a bit like a tin can phone. Intelligibility is not a problem, but the sound is a bit disconcerting. Most people I talk to say it sounds fine on the other end, but one complained of the tunnel sound.But it is a good value. It synched with my T-Mobile Wing right away. I think it dropped a couple of calls, but cannot be certain where the blame lies. I just walked away from the phone and when I came back it reconnected immediately.Other comments: The eyeglasses clip is a great idea but I'll have to modify it to work with my thin wire frames. The ear clip is fine. The supplied neck cord is a good idea, but I'm not using it. The belt clip seems a bit vulnerable as it sticks out pretty far.Mine was missing the full manual (a return?), but the online PDF was easy to find.Overall, I did expect slightly better performance, but am satisfied with the value and general function of this headset.","3.0","OK, but not spectacular","1188432000","08 30, 2007"

The product integrates well with everything (My Laptop - sony vaio, cellphone (siemens sx56, my panasonic cordless home phone (although with the panasonic, ppl complain about my voice being faint)).  But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says, that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices, it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better, but not totally gone).But in any case if you don't hear the crackling, it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you, not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all, if you read the manual, this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones, then you're lucky).

Given its low price, though, it's a great value, though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A-, nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very floppy fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced speakerphone effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call. THIS IS FALSE. You must leave the H500 turned on and actively connected to your phone in order to use it, just like any other headset.","3.0","Successor to the HS820, but could be better.","1131580800","11 10, 2005"

Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and doesn't allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear.

Naturally, the further you get from your phone the reception deteriorates. Volume and clarity are fine and sound just like holding my phone up to my ear.Overall it's a good headset and fine for my purposes.

"A3AUR4JFEJNXDY","B0006I2E1O","anthonyg","[50, 50]","Right off I have to say that when it comes to cell service and phones and the inherent contracts: you get what you pay for, in more ways than one, and buyer beware!  I do my research, ad nauseum, before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider. I've been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730. Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected.  But like I said, I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service.  Got the phones from Amazon.I, too, was taken by the looks of the RAZR, and so was my wife once she saw one.  But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for?  For one, Nextel wasn't making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service.  (Plus, the price for an upgrade phone for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view.  Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact!)I got two RAZR's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon, but your rebates with Cingular aren't worth the effort - and paid $99 each, best price *anywhere.*  I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel.  A *bunch* of money.  Two words: rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone, reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well, if not better, than my i730, which is a *great* phone, and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony, Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have.  I repeat: I read some of the manual, which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book, shame on you.  I was worried about the address book based on reviews, but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone, I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some.  There are so many ways to configure the address book it's silly.  You can assign and create categories  for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life, the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it, better than half the phones on the market today.  I can say that cos I feel like I've researched about half the phones on the market ... :)  Do this: plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night.  I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone? How clumsy are you?  I've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it.  Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot, which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times.  I'm happy with the material and it's expected durability.  Stop throwing your delicate, *expensive,* micro-electronic device around like it's made of teflon.  *Be careful.*I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it's nature usually expensive and difficult.  (A good example is the ROKR, the so-called iTunes phone.  I have an iPod, and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod,I would have bought it, but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that isn't the easiest thing to pull off well ...) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink  of an eye.  It's expensive because it's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious.  Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities, so don't be surprised by that.  Want a good camera phone for Cingular? The Sony s710 got great reveiws; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs.  That's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it's not working out for me.  So there's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone.  Still, I did my research so there wouldn't be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps.","4.0","Lovely phone - get what you pay for... !","1126828800","09 16, 2005"

"A39KJOCZGCM8P1","B0006I2E1O","Chris Lee Mullins","[37, 38]","I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated.1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the MORE function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the audio sweet spot on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet. My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.","3.0","Great looking phone....if yer into that sort of thing","1125100800","08 27, 2005"

I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size.","3.0","WARNING - ROTTEN BATTERY LIFE!

I just spent all that money on a super exclusive cool phone, and they make me buy software for $30? That's actually kind of crazy.They also messed up on the phone book. 450 Outlook contacts, that were spawned from 200 core contacts - each cell phone, business, email, and home entry for an individual is a separate entry. Way way too unwieldy. They need to update this error big time. They've also missed on priority numbers - you know, you identify people you call a lot, and they go to the head of the list. I'm used to the problems now, but wow what a miss on their part.The camera, oh it takes pictures. They look decent on the cell phone, but forget much more.

"A952LJOXPLTVL","B0006I2E1O","K. Allen Cram34","[46, 55]","I bought this becasue I was very happy to see a phone with a metal case again.  I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me.  Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away.  The best phone I ever had.  Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos.  Really big disapointment.  Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia.  When this came out I jumped on it.  Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS:-Some what sturdy case.  The metal parts seem solid. No marks as of yet (1 month).-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone.  I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it.  I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor.  And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size.  Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS:-Not all of it is metal.  The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic.  It creaks when you push on it.  I think that is where the antenna is, and if it has a SAR rating of .80 (I think) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting.  Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right?-The vol is almost a joke it is so low.  At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting.  I used to have to turn people down on my cell, now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt.  The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail.  The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean.  The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it.  When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book.  Good god man.  The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they don't put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up.  Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto.  Past experiences with them was very poor.  You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they didn't even read what the problem was before they fix it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times.  You buy another.  Strong durable plastic is used all the time.  For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time.  I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same.  This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar basic cell phone.  I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best.  Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now. 250 or something on Amazon as of now.  Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon.  They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM.  I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version.  But of course I have no real clue.  Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all.  It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote.  I am not getting paid for this and won't waste my time.

In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such. If you're looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less. But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I'm a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually, a better analogy would be: The Acura NSX of mobile phones. Like the NSX, I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola. It's their way of saying, &#34;We're known for inexpensive phones, but, look, we can build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;Unless wireless technology improves from GSM, the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years. The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I've heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna. It certainly makes perfect sense to me (unless the metal frame IS the antenna) as all the other areas are cold to touch (in this weather) while those areas are usually room temperature. Furthermore, it would be misrepresentation on Motorola's part to advertise it as such. Regardless, this phone may seem flimsy, but it's very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend's V551.Mikey's likeys:1- The mini-USB port. This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it's simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I'll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I've got to admit, the V3's speaker phone is the bomb. It's loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don't have my Bluetooth headset, I'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner's manual. I have found that the owner's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It's like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola's technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I'm hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend's $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it's akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it's only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don't have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia's implementation (refer to my owner's manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It's been nearly three weeks since I've bought this phone and no buyer's remorse.","5.0","The Ferrari of Mobile Phones","1100995200","11 21, 2004"
"AYW1TGDCP2OK6","B0006I2E1O","MestaySS","[0, 0]","I've had this phone for a while now and here's what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it's not as intuitive as say, Nokia's interface, but it does have some pros.  You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys.  I have my left soft key programmed to go to Shortcuts and I have every function I need right there.  And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent.  I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me.  Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone's memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook's address book, so I'm not too worried about having them on my SIM card.  And if you have a MAC, iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR....now THAT'S cool!The screen is very large and clear.  I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light.  I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far.  In fact, I have a stronger signal in most places than my previous phone (Nokia 6230)Overall, I am very pleased with the design, functions, and asthetics of this phone.","5.0","So far, so great!","1132099200","11 16, 2005"

Initally I was very happy and excited with my purchase, but after a couple of weeks the novelty wore off and its shortcomings became apparent. The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little M circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good. And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it, you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye. Kind of hard to explain, except for those of you with the phone. Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551. The third is the camera. I rarely use a phone cam, but the times I needed it, the pictures looked, well...horrible. And last but not least, the reception. The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The v551 actually had better reception. My new LG CE500 actually has MUCH better reception and is generally a much better phone. This phone is a GOOD phone. Nothing more nothing less.","3.0","Ok phone.

Allen","[0, 0]","If you look carefully at these so called bad reviews you will notice most of them either don't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a shared plan from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your Cell phone Numbers right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a single 700 rollover mins shared plan before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to My Account from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular in my area puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away With NO ROAMING charges btw our last cell phone service Alltel would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in Speaker Phone mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call Mobile to Mobile.We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it needs charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the address book being slow not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don't, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by Name or Speed dial # or Voice name or even by Email and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for Voice command it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for list only no picture and by primary number only, simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in Categories such as Business/Personal/General/VIPsBring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have primary number only listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about ear piece volume too low  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the volume is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the top edge of the phone, too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose PHONE seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under sunlight is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them.","5.0","Look carefully at the bad reviews","1128643200","10 7, 2005"

The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively.  My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement.  It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner.  I was concerned about the thickness and durability.  This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone.  I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone.  With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip.  I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola.  On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning.  I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together.  It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone.","4.0","Razr V3 works great for me.","1162166400","10 30, 2006"

I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.","5.0","Excellent Phone","1125878400","09 5, 2005"

Jarvis","[17, 18]","I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.","5.0","I've had a good experience with this phone","1114473600","04 26, 2005"

There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling.

"A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y","B0006I2G3U","Steven Metz","[32, 34]","Bottom LineStrongly recommended.  This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it learns one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola's support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn't been able to fix the problem.  I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software.","4.0","I'm Very Pleased","1117152000","05 27, 2005"

This headset fits and works perfectly.If you are familiar with the mono headset that shipped with older Palm or Handspring Treo phones, this headset is a stereo version. The buds are hard plastic in-the-ear type with a thin cushion (which you must install without tearing). The microphone is on the left bud, and is held close to your mouth because the left side wire is much shorter than the right side. The mic has an answer/hang up button. And the set is terminated by a 3/32 four conductor plug.The build and sound quality of this set are good. The plug has strain relief and the wiring is thin but more rugged than expected.  The buds have bass ports and the mic capsule is a reasonable size. The Centro has a microSD card for storing MP3 tracks, and this headset does a good job reproducing the dynamic range of classical music.There are better headsets available. But if you want a headset to fit a stereo Treo with a mic, answer button, and decent sound, it's hard to find one that costs less.

Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.","3.0","Good  headset but has its flaws","1144540800","04 9, 2006"

(It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear.It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery.The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them.

It seems like they have now added one picture in which you can kind of see it from the side. This is no a problem, it holds well, but a magnet might have been nice.The only real drawbacks are that when you keep the cover closed for a while, it may leave small horizontal smudge marks on the phone from the card pockets.

I wound up ordering both, this and a REIKO case.  They both work good separately, but not together.  If you try to use both, it is almost impossible to remove the Note 2 from the REIKO as it becomes stuck due to the tight fit.  I decided to use the BoxWave exclusively and have not been dissatisified with my decision.  I simply slide the Note 2 into my front pocket.  And no, the phone isn't too big for my pants pocket.The pros for this case is that it makes the Note 2 look stylish, and due to the rubbery feel, it makes the phone feel quite stable in my hand; however, the rubbery feel doesn't interfere with it going in and out of my pocket.  If I had to come up with a con for the BoxWave Tuxedo Suitup case, it would be that due to its glossiness, it shows fingerprints,  However, they wipe off easily.In summary, I would definitely order one of these cases again.","5.0","Great case","1357084800","01 2, 2013"

It was from one of those 2 piece rubber and hard plastic cases that Amazon sells for about $7.00. I can't remember the name but as soon as I do I will update this review so you can order this case and holster combo just for the holster.

"A1XDM756QE06E4","B0007MAOOS","Gregg L. DesElms Gregg L. DesElms","[2, 2]","First, I'm a huge fan of TPU cases; and hate silicone ones.  There's a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn't know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there's anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it's because they're cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It's perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there's no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that's a huge mistake.  If you've ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you've ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you've seen the dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won't turn on or off, or can't have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don't realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there's still the electromechanical HOME key that's uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that's wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There's not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it's a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I'll bet, don't know about, and that's precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It's really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren't like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there's the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass's edge all-'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table's surface.Well, the Note II's glass is actually higher up (when it's lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II's glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case's bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it's the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II's screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK 3D screen protector for the Note II) that's molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and hang down over it, so to speak, to make the protector's edge come closer to the case's bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that's fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK 3D style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn't touch because it's being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge respects the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and doesn't try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector's edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II's glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn't show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called s-style or s-series TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the s shape on the case's back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the s shape on the case's back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that's on those s cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those s series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn't work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those s style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it's worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don't cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a 3D type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK's other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II's screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L.

I like this because the buttons work just as well but they are protected at the same time from crud/damage.  Cutouts for the ports/mics/camera/stylus are placed perfectly and sized appropriately.

In the past, people on the other end of my calls always complained about wind noise, with this headset that isn't an issue anymore.  Additionally, the headset is very comfortable to wear.There is only one item to be careful of.  When I first tried the unit I didn't realize that there was a mute function on the control cord.  As a result I called a particular person a few times and they couldn't hear me.  Finally, I figured out what was going on.  Of course it was user error.

So, I try this new MX505.Although I am very impress by the sound quality and unique design, it doesn't fit me too well.  Let me summarize the Pros and Cons first:Pro:Sound qualityDesign fit almost every ear type: the grey area on the ear piece is actually, soft plastic.  It makes it very easy to adjust and fairly comfortable to wear.it comes with a spare voice tubesvolumn adjustable controlCon:the cord is a little short for me, and it is around 8 cm shorter than my old MX110.  I prefer to put the phone on a further distance when I use the phone.  So, it won't bother me when I work.  If the cord is at least 30 cm or 50cm longer, it would be great.The  design doesn't fit me well... or it wouldn't wear for long comfortably.  The main reason is that it is soft plastic, not cushioned like the MX110.  Yes, it is able to clip onto the ear much better than other design.  I still feel the clip plain after wearing it for 10 min.  It is not a very painful feeling, just not very comfortable.The volumn control is good, but the build quality is not.  It uses rather cheap or thin plastic shell.  Additionally, the Mute button is not the soft push eletonic type.  It is the older switch design type, which you push to the right is Mute and push to the left is Unmute.  It is rather chessy to me.My main suggestion to plantronic is that, please add the cushion on the ear clip.  Secondly, please either take out the volumn control or improve it or offer longer cord.  I mean, if the cord is not long enough, why do you need a volumn control?","4.0","Good Sound Quality and Unique design, but not always fit everyone.","1154995200","08 8, 2006"

I cannot stand the A/C wall charger that came with the Fire. It is ridiculously short making it very difficult to find a place to charge it safely and I have purchased several of these cords since last Christmas and a majority work for a while and then break or don't work at all. Sometimes it is hit or miss and then sometimes a cord charges and then sometimes it acts up and refuses to charge. I have the same plug on my Samsung Stratosphere and I don't seem to have the same problem.With this cord the part that plugs into the Fire virtually fell apart.

The PowerGen charger is a little large for the inconvenient location of the accessory port in my Toyota Scion xD, and so I liked the low profile of this charger. However, from the reviews, I got the impression that this charger would not charge an Android phone at high capacity. So I also purchased aUSB Charging Cablewhose pin configuration is setup to trick an Android phone to charge in 1A AC mode. Sadly, the cable I received appears to be a standard USB data cable. However, to my surprise, the iPhone / iPod port (the top port) triggers the AC charging mode of my Samsung Galaxy Nexus Android phone. So in that case, I don't need any special cable. I can use the top port for my device, and my wife's iPhone charges in the bottom iPad / iPad2 port.This charger extends itself about 0.25 inches (6 mm) out of the accessory port. It's much more compact than the PowerGen (which also has Apple and Android ports), but there are a few dual chargers that are a little shorter. In our car, the PowerGen has a problem that it sometimes doesn't fit well in the port and a connection isn't made without re-seating it. We were surprised by this, because the nearly identicalMediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger(which only is high capacity for Apple devices) has no trouble fitting in our car. Sadly, this BoxWave charger also sometimes loses connection and we have to re-seat it.For now, I'm happy with the device. It charges my Android phone in AC mode and appears to charge my wife's iPhone. It is relatively low profile (our cups in the adjacent cupholders don't seem to bump into it so much), and it feels like a sturdy device. I just hope it is able to maintain a reliable connection over time.","4.0","Surprised to find that one of the ports charges an Android phone at 1A!

I have received several compliments and questions regarding where they can get their own.

When I put the phone in the case, it came out almost immediately. Solution: take the back cover off the phone then put it in the case. It holds it much more securely and now I don't have to worry about it. The case itself seems well made and thicker than I had hoped, but hopefully that will protect the phone well.

(The new Twelve South iPhone 5 bookbook case has a clip to secure the iPhone 5, rather than sliding the phone into the leather holster and securing with the tab at the top.) Personally, I loved the Twelve-South's bookbook case for iPhone 4/4S, but didn't like the new Twelve-South bookbook case for iPhone 5 and I returned mine - it looked cheaply made, it was an extremely tight, awkward fit getting the phone into the clip and the case had large remnants of glue coming out of the over-sized piece of plastic they decided to stick in the (rather enormous) hole they cut for the camera.  This product is better quality than the Twelve South product.  It certainly looks and feels like real leather, although I suspect it may not be (based on its smell).

Fiori A Concerned Parent","[9, 13]","Want to basically eliminate your issues with holding this device in a secure way while maintaining the total coolness of it?This may be just what you were looking for. Seems to be actual leather unlike many similar cases that claim to be leather and are actually plastic. So if you wear skinny jeans and tend to keep the phone shoved in a pocket, this is not for you. But if you carry it elsewhere and are not concerned with combining your phone with some essential bits of your wallet, this is really really nice. If you tend to travel in a car and wind up carrying both the phone and your wallet into places to eat. This allows you to get three basic things out of the wallet and eliminate the need to carry two into the restaurant.It makes holding onto the phone less complicated by a factor of a googol. Particularly in landscape.The material (seems to be leather) is impregnated with a serious amount of oil so when you close the lid, it leaves a mark on the face of the phone. The simple solution to this is to get a paper index card, fold it at the red line on the top and shove the little folded bit in to the slot behind the cards. Not only do you then have the &#34;old way&#34; to fall back on if you need to actually write anything down )or have someone write something down for you(, but you add a perfect layer of weightless scratch proof protection to your ever so fragile Nexus 4 screen.For less than what you might pay for the 'official' bumper....no brainer.","5.0","Fantastic addition to the Nexus 4","1368489600","05 14, 2013"

By the time I put my driver's license in there (an exceptionally tight fit on the windowed part of the case and I was almost not able to remove it later) and a couple of credit cards it was actually too thick to keep in any pocket comfortably. The covers of the case are very thick while they protect the phone and contents, two of them are too much when combined with the thickness of my thin Nexus 4 and a couple of credit cards.

Frankly it is the the most comfortable headset I have ever worn, and I've worn dozens.  I truly forget it is on my head.As for sound quality, everything I hear is clear, with ample volume available.  People I speak to report equally clear sound without much, if any background noise.Battery life is great and range is sufficient for me to put my smartphone on the cradle and walk around the house or the office without any signal loss or crackling.Something else I liked was the belt clip.  So many headsets overlook the fact that you have nowhere to put your earpiece when you're not using it.  The belt clip is small, just big enough to actually hold the headset, and tucks in right behind the clip for my phone.If you're not a clip-loving person, the whole headset has an almost flat profile so it fits nicely in a pocket.  Other headsets, especially those with flip-out mics feel awfully bulbous in a pocket.One last little Gee Whiz feature- the vibro-alert.  Since I want my phone on the charge/sync cradle whenever possible, this feature really excites me.  Instead of being required to actually wear the headset at all times to avoid missing a call when the phone is in the other room, this headset has a vibrate feature to notify me of an incoming call.  I call this a gee whiz feature because I never knew I needed it until I had it!In summary, there are an awful lot of headsets out there.

Other than the Jabra, they were all the same, they had a loop that you hook onto your ear, so they did not fit.This is the only one headset that would properly wrap around my ear and because the ear piece goes into the ear canal, stay anchored. Sound quality is great. The HS 810 would not hold a charge very long. So far so good with this Jabra --- it holds a charge while the Motorola needed to be charged all of the time.I like the vibrating feature when the phone ringer is turned off --- no need to share all that noise. As I am on call or expecting calls often when I am out at dinner, this really makes it discreet rather than missing the call and playing telephone tag for awhile.Sound quality is better than the Motorola HS 810. Jabra seems to work well for those who have small ears and their ear cells make it adjustable.If you don't need the vibrating feature, try the new Jabra BT 500 which is an upgrade of the Jabra BT 250, charging can be USB cable which is great as you will not have to take another charger on the trip!I also have the Jabra SP500 which is a wireless speakerphone and it works great vs. the Motorola speakerphone which I returned.

It's a nice design, and if it worked I'd be very happy with it.UPDATE: I just got a new BT250v after Amazon was kind enough to exchange my unit sight unseen (they even shipped out the new unit before I'd shipped back the bad one). Unfortunately, while the new unit works somewhat better, it still doesn't work as well as it should. For example, there is noticeable popping (interference) if i put my phone in my pocket, even on the same side as the headset. I've tried many combinations of phone and headset, and the only time I have problem is with this headset, so I'm quite sure it's not an issue with my phone, or with bluetooth in general. (In fact, I've had far better luck with other Jabra BT products.) So, the design is beautiful and the product is great when it works, but I've found that it fails when I really need it.FINAL UPDATE: I chucked it. Don't believe the breathless reviews about this. If you use this in everyday life--i.e. with the phone more than a few feet from your head--people on the other end will hear static.

"A3IAAVB63OE76I","B0007UC5U6","T. J Wilson tomjw217","[9, 9]","I bought this headset to work with my Audiovox SMT5600, not listed by Jabra as compatible, but I took the chance anyway. The headset, which I purchased online, arrived with no instructions, but did include the charger, charger cord, belt hook, and several earbuds. A quick search online discovered the manual and pairing was accomplished shortly thereafter. All functions of the headset, including vibrating ring and voice dial, work with my phone. Sound quality is generally excellent -- it's at least as good as the phone's earpiece. All bets are off if you're out in the wind or driving with the window down, precisely the same conditions under which you can't hear the phone's own earpiece either. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The short boom mike seems to be acceptable -- nobody has complained they can't hear me. In fact, I can talk pretty softly under most circumstances and be heard just fine. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The battery is advertised to last a long time and it does. I haven't measured any run-down times, but the headset needs to be charged less often than the phone, which with bluetooth on needs a charge every couple days. The headset is light and, for me, comfortable; after wearing it 12 hours a day for the first several days I forget it is there. The headset is reversable by the simple expedient of rotating the earbud. The dorsal sping of the headset contains one button and one rocker switch. Because of the location of the switches they do not need reversing. The rocker controls volume up and down; the button combines on/off and answer/hang-up. Press the button to answer or hangup, hold for about 5 seconds to turn off/on. My phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently, so does the headset. The headset slips into the charging cradle like a knife into a holster. An accessory clip attaches to the charging cradle so you can hang the cradle (unplugged, of course) on your belt or waistband to carry the headset when it's not being worn. With practice, the headset can be put on with one hand. There is no provision for charging in an automobile, which would be inconvenient were battery not so long-lasting. Just pop the headset into the charger in the evening and you're good for the next day. On an extended trip the charging cord and cradle must accompany the traveler.  Other than the lack of a car adapter, which can be remedied aftermarket, my only complaint is that the headset is somewhat wobbly on my ear and the ear bud occasionally works itself away from my ear canal. This is not always immediately apparent until a call is made/received. This is aggravaated by the fact that there is no way to adjust the headset, it being constructed of a plastic shell with a soft lining against the ear. Even the flexible shaft holding the ear bud does not adjust side to side.  The headset is rated for up to 30 meters; this does not include walls or other obstructions. Jabra recommends you wear the headset on the same side that you carry your phone. Practice proves this. Lack of adjustability aside, this is a good headset with outstanding battery life. It's available at a reasonable price and, thus far, no other headset has wooed me away.","4.0","A Nice Headset","1147219200","05 10, 2006"

"A25LM23UM50GD","B0007W1K3C","Mark Sorokahdeen","[21, 22]","Shure's QuietSpot headset is the best headset on the market, period. The only problem with it is Shure's coyness about how it works and why microphone placement is *absolutely crucial* when using it. Once you understand that, you understand everything you need to in order to want it more than you want anyone else's.The problem with the QuietSpot--mentioned by other reviewers here--is not a failure of engineering or quality control, but one of emphasis in their documentation. Barring an actual defective unit (which will usually not work at all) there is nothing wrong with the QuietSpot that proper adjustment doesn't totally eliminate. I believe that Shure doesn't tell you this for fear of alienating technically unsophisticated customers. Since I have nothing to sell you, I am blissfully unconcerned with boring you and can write something useful. Please note that I write this on the basis of a close examination of a working QuietSpot and an educated layman's knowledge.Observation tells me that, Shure's QuietSpot headset uses active noise cancellation and it is the only cellular headset on the market that does.  This means that the mouthpiece of the headset uses two microphones: one takes in the sound from the world around you while the second takes in the sound from your mouth.Using  a trick of wiring, this dual-microphone arrangement uses the sound from the outside world and uses it to weaken the sound from the microphone closer to our mouth. Since both microphones take in surrounding sound, the strongest sound that *isn't* cancelled out is your voice.For this to work, the microphones need very good alignment with your mouth. The  QuietSpot demands that you have the 'mouth-side' microphone pointed directly at your mouth, and the 'world side' microphone pointed directly outwards without mis-alignments like having the microphone-housing too far below or two far above the side of your mouth, or having the microphone housing turned on its side.The tough part about this is that the boom that holds the microphone can twist and bend while the QuietSpot is in your pocket or case, turning the microphone head around onto its side. If the microphone-head is turned on it's side, or set too far above or below your mouth, then both microphones pick up your voice with equal intensity and the arrangement does exactly as it's supposed to: It treats *your voice* like background-noise and sends everything you say off into oblivion.The solution is easy and useful: you have to learn to put the QuietSpot's microphone in the right place every time you put it on. Once you learn to do this with the windscreen on, you have what is close to the perfect headset. I have used the QuietSpot, standing in bars in New York City with the jukebox blasting and not had to raise my voice very far above an ordinary conversational volume and with the QuietSpot's noise-blocking earpiece, I could hear my listener perfectly. The two-way noise elimination of a well-adjusted QuietSpot is amazing, providing a sense of intimacy and privacy in conversations that no other headset ever gave me including one or two that cost more.The only other thing you need to know about the QuietSpot is that it is particularly sensitive to wind=noise and unless you intent to never use it outside, it is best to keep the windscreen permanently attached to the unit. You can do this with a needle and thread through the foam, or with a thin-strand of wire. Once you've done this, you'll have to learn to make the important adjustment by touch but even then, it's still easy.Now that you know all this, give the QuietSpot a try. You won't be disappointed.","5.0","Brilliant Engineering, slightly unclear documentation","1175212800","03 30, 2007"

I was quite happy with the audio quality (folks I talked to never complained about background noise, even while driving) and battery life was more than adequate.  Additionally I thought the button functions like mute, swapping calls, etc. were pretty easy to use.Why then, you ask, did you rate it only four out of five stars?  I'm glad you asked!My disappointment came when I merged my cell phone and PDA by buying a smartphone, an HP iPaq.  The headset connected to the new phone without a hitch and worked flawlessly... for a while.After anywhere from a day to a month, without any warning, the headset would cease working, refusing to connect to the phone.  The fix required hard resetting the phone every time it failed.Since hard resetting at random intervals was hardly an acceptable way to go about business, I called Motorola for support.  Without so much as a single step of troubleshooting I was told to contact the phone manufacturer, HP.Would you like to guess what HP told me?  If you guessed Call Motorola, you win the cupie doll.  After calling both manufacturers repeatedly, begging for any input they could give, HP admitted that this headset was not one of a very small group of headsets specifically approved as compatible with the phone.  They added that not being on the list does not necessarily mean it won't work, after all it worked just fine for random periods of time (read: I very well could have a defective headset in my hands).Motorola's response never waivered... Go talk to HP.I knock off a star not for the very plausible prospect that the problem could lie with the phone manufacturer, but for the less than cordial attitude.  Refusing to even troubleshoot a product is called passing the buck.  For all they knew, it very well could have been a defective unit but they were too quick to dismiss me to know for sure.My solution was to buy aJabra BT250v Bluetooth Headset with Vibrating Alert [Retail Packaged], after which I had no problems.My summary would be that this headset will likely perform beautifully with any Motorola phone.

My SX66 recognizes the HS850 headset within a second (I'm at the latest Bluetooth v1.1 driver from Siemens/Microsoft - I tried applying the patch from Siemens' website, but the phone was already at the latest version).In short, everything works well, and the ambient noise cancellation features seem to work well, according to the people I'm talking to.I haven't run this to the point it has completely lost power - I don't know how long it lasts.

Good range for the signal. Some areas you have an increased static interference, but it's pretty minimal. Occational pop-sounds, not crackling or static for the most part. I guess you could say not a lot of bass and volume can't be made loud but is certainly loud enough for regular calls. Traffic/other loud background noise will wash out calls...but that's no different than wired headsets (or natice cell useage either).I have about 50-50 usage of the headset wearing it and leaving it closed in the pocket. I charge it every night, never had a low-battery problem in a day. Talk 2-4hrs a day on average. If in the pocket I can get it out, unflipped and talking on the phone before the call cancels (it's close though). Thought the flip close was wierd at first, but probably the best interface, wouldn't want to have to mess with a button to wakeup/connect. Connect time to cell is about 1-2 seconds after opening.Comfort is the worst thing about this headset. Leaving it on for 1-2hrs your ear will be SORE. Half of the headset is very stiff plastic with heavy wire inside, other half is flimsy plastic (looks like it would be soft on the ear but doesn't seem that way). Doesn't seem to sit nicely in the ear and you can't adjust  up/down/back/forward. I can see why that is, because the ear part is spring-loaded to keep headset tight against the ear but it's not good.Worth the money, hope a newer version improves the comfort level.","4.0","Good bluetooth and call quality, hard on the ear","1124323200","08 18, 2005"

In fact, I went through FOUR HS850 headsets (under warranty) before Motorola decided to upgrade me to the H700 (despite the lower model number, the H700 is a newer model).The HS850 and H700 have the same characteristics:- Over-the-ear swing arm earpiece that can be used on left or right ear- Flip-open boom microphone that turns the headset on/off- Easy volume controls- Toggle switch to connect/disconnect calls (or put them on hold/mute)- Easy pairing- Good published battery life- Standard Motorola power connectorsWhat's the difference?  Well, good published battery life is the distinction.  All four of the HS850 headsets worked for a few weeks or months, but then would not hold a charge.  Battery life went down to MINUTES.Dealing with Motorola support was a nightmare.  Apparently, their support center for these products was in Argentina, and they could only do what was in their script to help me.  After the fourth failure, I insisted on getting a support contact at their corporate HQ in Illinois.  That support contact was a dream.  After reviewing my case, he gave me the H700 as a replacement.  I had that headset for 1.5 years, and it had kept its battery life and functionality.  Of course, I lost it and had to buy a replacement...and given all the choices, I got another H700.Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850.  I've seen prices as low as $15 for this model.

It helps if you turn the volume gain up on the cell phone itself, but that causes some echo for the other person that is talking to you.  My wife and I each have one of these headsets, and they are both identical with the low volume output issue.  They also both emit a light hissing sound in the earpiece when talking.  Overall these shortcomings are outweighed by the positives of this device.

I found the headset to be much more comfortable than the Jabra BT250v that I used to have.  It is very lightweight, and the earhook fits pretty well.  I stick the headset on the charger for a little while when I get home from work each day so I never have battery issues.  The call quality is adequate on both ends.  I would like the volume a little louder, but it will do.  My wife said that she could hear an echo of herself.  This is due having the volume all the way up with the speaker and mic being so close together.  However, she couldn't tell a difference between having the A/C on high or low in terms of background noise.  This was also an improvement over the Jabra BT250v.Here's what you need to know about limitations.  Even though both devices support the handsfree profile, you only get the headset profile when you pair the HS-850 and a Treo 650.  This would seem to be Treo's issue.  Bottom line is that you have to press the multi-function button to transfer calls, and you can't use some of the advanced handsfree profile features.

I kept it in my pocket so it would be on standby, in contact with my phone.  Most times, it would connect quickly and function well.  Ocassionally, it would seem to connect, but when I attempted an outgoing call, it would disconnect.I also had trouble hearing the unit while driving.  As I am approaching my mid 50's, my hearing is not as acute as in past years, and the internal noise from the pickup truck (windows up, and AC running) makes hearing the other party on the earpiece difficult.My main problem with this unit is the recharge plug.  I have 3 Nextel/Motorola phones that use this type of plug and have not had any trouble with it.  The plug end has a release button to depress when unplugging.  The catch on my HS850 charger plug was more difficult to release and required much more pressure to release than my other 2 Motorola charger plugs of the same type.  This contributed to undue stress on the socket and eventually the socket pulled loose.  I probably charged it 6-7 times over the month I had it.I intend to replace my HS850 with some other type that has an earpiece that fits in my ear, providing some sound isolation from environmental noises, rather than the lay on this ear type.Be careful unplugging this unit from its charging plug.","3.0","Charging plug catch pulled out charging socket","1155168000","08 10, 2006"

The Moto is a heck of a lot better - sound quality pretty good on the calls, functions with the Moto E815 no problem - voice dialing works without a hitch, volume on the phone controls headset volume, redial function, etc.  The moto is kind of clunky feeling - you know you're wearing it but not that uncomfortable.  Just a big plastic thing hanging off the top of your ear rather than the in the ear school of thought.  I love my Jabra wired headset - don't know why the BT was so horrible.  Works fine in the car as long as the windows are rolled up - affected by wind noise, high background volume, etc.  But that's to be expected.

I do not have any problems with it and have used it extensively.  It's great to have some kind of hands-free, wireless device.  This one sits on my ear and is out of the way.After 2 years of use, the silicone part around the earpiece that seals the earpiece to your ear has come away from from the plastic.  Not really a big deal, but it is breaking away from normal use.  I've never dropped it or abused it in any way, so I would have expected it to last longer than this.  Performance is still good though.It does sit a little precariously on my ear, it's just a light wrap around my ear, so if I lean over too much, there is a danger it can fall off.  Care must be taken when you're wearing it.  And even though it is one of the smaller wireless units, it's still heavy after wearing it for a few hours.

But if that's not an issue, then both are equal IMHO.  Both have the cheek problem!Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and you'll blame it on the bluetooth!TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you!

It feels well made and has a beautiful quality generously proportioned screen; a definite plus for folks who like games on their cells. Although the Amazon listing calls it a Tri-band phone, it is in fact Quad-band. Most importantly for me, it speaks Mac. Using a data cable ( pick up a cheapie on ebay ) it functions flawlessly with iSync for iCal and Address Book. The only thing that I'm not very pleased about is that contact email and addresses don't seem to transfer to the phone ( the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ). There might be a way to accomplish this, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.But what I really like about his phone is that it functions quite handsomely as a wireless bluetooth modem. My phone uses the T-Mobile network, and combined with the   all the data you can eat  program ( around $20 a month ) and my iBook with a D-Link BT adapter, and I'm good to go. The set up is a bit complex, but the nice folks at T-Mobile supplied me with the  info.It's controls are very easy to use and it looks great, I live in a signal challenged area, but I have found that the V330 works better then any other cell I have ever owned. The photo quality isn't anything to write home about, though the zoom feature is pretty effective.  Generally speaking I like my cell phones to have data card capacity, particularly for photo storage, but T-Mobile has a nifty Album feature which lets you store your pics online.

"A14EF1PPKMSEPU","B0008F6QE6","E. Brown EB","[16, 18]","This is actually a quad-band mobile phone which makes it a true 'world phone'... more so than the common tri-band devices.World phones are generally equipped w/ both 1900 and 1800 frequencies. Together, these frequencies cover Europe, much of the U.S. and many other countries. Most tri-band units, however, are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.850 fills in the 'rural gaps' in The States. 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia. Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900. They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they don't provide a needed frequency... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.How is T-Mobile? Truth of the matter (as with any mobile phone service) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in. Sorry, there is no across-the-board answer. As soon as one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.Visually, this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone, but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys. The screen is vivid and bright. The ringtone gets plenty loud. For these reasons, it's a great phone for seniors who still want a modern phone. I just got one for my mum.Of course, being a quad-band, video, camera, multi-zoom, bluetooth, infrared device w/ browser, the general ease of operation can only be so easy. That 'said,' many a senior probably couldn't be bothered w/ messing with it all or putting to test call quality in rural U.S. and New Zealand.That you get all of this and at such a price makes the V330 an eyebrow-raising steal.One more thing - That it's blue, not the de riguer black or silver, I like.A quality phone packed w/ a host of goodies.

There are a few minor flaws that I've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.PROS-Solid reception - seems to hold calls pretty well - have not experienced unexpected call drops.-As near as I can tell people are hearing my calls clearly-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words-While on T-Mobile you can be browsing the web and also receive an incoming voice call (though you cannot continue to browse - the key is that it doesn't send people to your Voicemail). I believe this is a function of the GSM technology that T-Mobile and Cingular operate under.CONS-Earpiece volume is low - you'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.-Not EDGE (high speed Internet) capable-If there is a way to have multiple contact info (home, business, cell, email) for one address book entry - I haven't found it. Instead I have awkwardly had to setup multiple address entries (how 1980's).-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off. Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the smart keys to do the task.-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this (kinda) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select. The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.SUMMARYI'd purchase this phone again for T-Mobile. I considered other phones before making this purchase and the overall features (including the ability to use Bluetooth)are what attracted me to the V330.The requirement to list multiple names in the phone book is really odd and it might be that I just haven't found the secret. The phone doesn't come with any type of detailed user manual so you have to go online and look at a PDF to get the information. So far I have not uncovered any secret. If I had a large phone book that I wanted to use, then I'd probably have passed on this phone (and any other Motorola using a similar scheme).If you are frequently in noisy environments, this probably is not the phone for you either. The earpiece is just too low. I'm constantly trying to raise the volume when talking to someone out in a crowded place that has noise.For a good middle-of-the road phone with solid reception, I don't think you can go too wrong with the V330.","4.0","Solid Performer","1129507200","10 17, 2005"

"A1ULPGDCSX8XUH","B000982UY2","Jeantet Fields","[182, 185]","I have owned a Treo 650 on and off and on again since this model came out.  Initially, I was extremely frustrated by the phone's telephone performance and its lack of stability.  Frequent reboots, freezes and dropped calls made it difficult to appreciate the phone.  I ended up getting rid of it and relying on a separate palm and cell phone.  Over time, PalmOne has released firmware updates (the phone's operating system) that have made the phone very stable.  The improvements we so significant that they actually won me back.  This review is for the GSM Treo 650.A word about Carriers: I only use GSM because I travel abroad frequently - this limits me to Cingular and Tmobile.  I have used both, and I have found that Cingular's network coverage is more complete, especially in rural areas, but Tmobile's network sounds better.  It's a tradeoff - with Tmobile, you'll drop the call more often, but with Cingular you'll say what? more often.  Their coverage is about equal in big cities and along major highways.  International roaming is less expensive with Tmobile, plus Cingular has a few hurdles in place that prevent you from enabling international roaming on your account if you've been with them for less than 6 months.  Verizon and Sprint use a cellular technology that is US-only, and therefore no good for using your phone abroad.Here are the phone's pros: in your pocket, you have your address book, datebook, notes, e-mail, low-res still and video camera, a very nice sms interface that threads sms exchanges by contact, a web browser, and an mp3 player.  The QWERTY keyboard makes typing much faster than a standard phone.  The interface is unique and you will need a little time to get used to it, but once you do you will be as efficient at quick-dialing and keeping up with daily use as on any other phone.  Also, this phone is a quad-band GSM which means that it will work very well abroad, unlike the more common tri-band GSM phones, which don't perform as well.  (Remember, if you get a Treo Smartphone from Verizon or Sprint, it will not work abroad.)  The screen on the Palm version is brilliant.  The Windows version is not as sharp - a limitation imposed by the operating system.  Also, GSM technology uses SIM cards, which means you can simply change out the SIM and use your phone on another network or another phone number, either domestically or while abroad.  (You might have a phone locked onto a carrier's network until your contract commitment is complete, but that's something you can sort out on your own).Here are the phone's cons: I said in your pocket because if you mount this thing on your belt, the bulge may force you to make alterations on your sport jacket.  Also, in an age of identity theft and information security, you should think long and hard about just how much information is in there.  Believe me, the phone quickly becomes a place to store passwords, account information, customer information, etc.  Consider how you will feel if you leave it in a restaurant, or if it's stolen.Here are lesser cons that can be worked around: The beauty of these palm phones is that they're so popular; other people have had whatever problem you might encounter, and they've written software to address / fix / work around the issue.  For example, I found that the phone's volume is not loud enough.  There is 3rd party volume software to fix that, as well as software that allows you to use the phone as a Bluetooth modem for your computer.  Some software is freeware, some is shareware, and some is for purchase.  The key is that there are so many forums and resources on the Internet that you can search around and find the answers that you need, and the phone allows you to install and uninstall with as much ease as with your home PC.Thoughts about newer Treo phones:  The 650 now costs a little less because the Treo 700w and 700p have come out.  This is a good thing, because I don't see the 700 having any new features that make the upgrade a must.  Other than a slightly redesigned appearance and interface, and higher resolution camera, the phone's features are basically identical.  Also, as of the Summer 2006, the Treo 700 is only available on CDMA networks.  The Treo folks have staggered the release of GSM and CDMA models to give the all carriers a turn at exclusivity.Looking to the future, there is speculation that the next generation Treo phone will be a GSM, it will be thinner, lighter, and the antenna will be internal - basically, it will more resemble a blackberry on the outside.  These are much sought after features by Treo users.  Maybe I'll upgrade then.In conclusion, only 4 stars for this phone because the product wasn't ready for market when they released it.  It's much better now; if they had initially released the current product, I would have given it 5 stars.  I hope my perspective helps you with your decision.UPDATE - Jan 08, 2007: the Treo750 (windows mobile) has come out in the UK with Vodafone, and here in the USA, the Treo680 (Palm OS) has been announced with Cingular.  In forums on the internet, people have reported that the new 680 addresses many wish-list items for the Treo faithful: slighly thinner (a modest few millimeters), internal antenna, better keyboard, volume-too-low issue sort of resolved, better mp3 player (pTunes instead of Real), more memory, improved phone interface, EDGE instead of GPRS to double the data speed.  Unfortunately, the camera has the same resolution (640x480) and the few millimeters thinner have meant a thinner battery.  Treo 680 owners complain of poor battery life (1 day or significantly less for power users).As of Thanksgiving, every vendor pre-selling the Treo 680 was sold out (including Amazon).  This tells me two things: many Treo users are looking to upgrade immediately by choice, not out of necessity.  As a result, the market should be flooded with inexpensive used Treo650s, and no doubt merchants with 650 inventory will probably sell them inexpensively enough for people who have been priced out of the smartphone market to get their hands on one.Palm says the 680 is targeted to the every day person, not the power user.  I suppose that means in a year we should expect another more expensive model that will be what the 680 should have been.  I feel that Palm is releasing new models in a very slow and calculated manner in order to drive consumer spending.My recommendation: if you want a Treo, go with the 650.  With an extended battery a power user (bluetooth, e-mail, etc.) can go 2 days between charges or 3 days with normal usage.  Look for it online.The smartphone market has become very crowded with the slim Motorola Q (windows), the comparably sized and feature-rich Nokia E61 (legendary stability of Symbian OS), friendlier and proven Blackberry models, the Samsung blackjack (windows), and lately the MDA (windows) is getting rave reviews with all the features you wish you could have, including Wi-Fi.The Treo does a lot - it probably has the best SMS interface on the market, but the rest is just ok.  For example, the mp3 player works, but not as good as a dedicated mp3 player like an iRiver or iPod.  The e-mail application works, but the IMAP implementation is poor, and POP3 performance is inconsistent re: leaving or deleting messages from the server.  If you want a good e-mail application on the Treo, you'll have to buy a 3rd party program that will be almost as good as the blackberry.  But you will have to buy this app, and the more 3rd party apps you load, the less stable the device.  What I'm saying is the Treo is a jack of many trades but it's a master of none (except SMS/MMS messaging.)  While I am a Palm faithful, I'm afraid that if you want a *stable* phone, e-mail, address book and schedule, the blackberry is the way to go, but you won't have the bells and whistles (camera, mp3 player, 3rd party apps and touch screen) that come with a Treo.  Yes, that means I now have a crackberry.  It was a Xmas gift from a friend who was tired of hearing me complain about my Treo.  Here is the bottom line: if you're getting this device as a business tool where missed calls or e-mails translate to lost money, get a blackberry.  If you want a really cool phone with all the bells and whistles you can fathom and you like loading 3rd party applications and you like having a fun device to play with, then you will absolutely love the Treo.","4.0","After getting used to it, you can't live without it.","1157673600","09 8, 2006"
"A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","B000982UY2","Jeff Edwards RadioJeff","[25, 25]","I have been itching for a Treo ever since the 600 came out and I noticed that more streamlined design.  When smartphones were first introduced, I bucked the trend of combining the two thinking that as often as I use my cell phone and my pda, if I bought one that integrated both I would wear it out twice as fast.  And in my humble opinion, it was a valid reason because back then, the original phone/pda's were impossibly large.  Well I have finally become a convert.I spent a great deal of time researching Blackberry's vs. the Treo's vs. Pocket PC's and came VERY close to grabbing a T-Mobile Dash (which I still believe is the all-around smallest model availabe as I write this, or at least it SEEMED to be), but I finally settled with the trusted Palm OS platform (one that I have become VERY familiar with over the years using pda's for quite some time now).  When I set out to get one, I really had my heart set on the Treo 680...but as I read the reviews for them, one thing kept creeping in to almost all the reviews: battery life was terrible.  With that aside, quite a few of the reviewers mentioned that all things considered, they were more happy with their old 650.  I saw this on so MANY reviews that I began to think twice.  Then I noticed that the 700p was a more beefed up version of the 650, and began to consider it as well.  Unfortunately as I write this, it isn't available with Alltell service where I am (it will, but nobody can give me a target date, and dang it, I am too impatient to wait...) so I am right back with the 650.  It took a while before Palm was able to knock enough of the bugs out of the 650 that I felt like buying one would be worth it...and I am discovering more than a few bugs have been associated with both the 680 & 700p, so no matter HOW much time I spend considering upgrading to a newer model, I find compelling reasons to go right back to the Old School 650.Reason #1 to go with it: Since it is no longer available at Palm's Official website, and with the newer models coming out, chances are you can find some pretty sweet deals on the older 650.Reason #2: Virtually ALL of the problems originally associated with the 650 have been eliminated.  You want Push email?  You can get it.  You want web surfing?  No prob.  You want to view AND edit MS Word Documents and Excell?  Easier than ever with the 650 (that was one major plus over most of the Pocket PC's and ALL of the Blackberrys -- sure you can VIEW some of these documents, but you cannot EDIT them, too).Reason #3: No matter HOW convenient the pda, I found it next to impossible to give up a touch-screen's amazing versatility and the ease with which you can use it to edit things and connect on websites.One more important item to factor in when considering buying a 650: With the popularity with ever increasing wireless downloading speeds, I was afraid that the slower Treo would make internet surfing next to impossible because of the archaic speeds with which you are forced to endure.  I was VERY pleastantly surprised that downloading web pages did not take as long as I was at first expecting.  I have to tell you, after experimenting with the supposedly MUCH faster 700p with another online carrier than the one I was using (I won't say which, but they really did their best to tell me the 650 was slower than a dial-up modem from 1985), anyway, the 650 was only SLIGHTLY slower than this screaming fast 700p or the 700w.  I figured that was something I could live with to be honest.  Hey, it's a tiny hand-held device that allows me to send and receive email and surf the web...I'm still amazed that something like this exists at ALL to be honest with you...so downloading speed is still secondary in my opinion.  If speed really IS on your list of absolutes, maybe you ought to move up to something else...but keep in mind, it is only BARELY faster than what I experienced first hand.One more thing: the screen is amazing.  There are only so many ways to say WOW.  If you are considering buying a Palm that runs Windows Mobile, you ought to know that the screen clarity is almost reduced by HALF.  This apparently has something to do with Window's OS, and seriously put my decision to buy one on the back burner.Sure there are things that a smartphone cannot as yet do without some difficulty or impossibility...but that is the same with ALL current models.  Do some SERIOUS research into what you want vs. what you NEED and make an informed decision only AFTER you have had the chance to go into a store and test a specific model PERSONALLY.  Do that and no matter WHAT you decide on, you will most likely be happy.  So far, I know I am VERY satisfied with my choice.  Good luck on yours.***UPDATE***I opted not to get a Bluetooth hands-free device -- at first.  Originally I would see people walking around with these Lt. Uhura type thingy's sticking out of their ears and I couldn't help but wonder how lazy people are that they cannot raise their hand up to their head while walking around simply to talk on the phone.  For the most part I STILL feel this way, but I decided to buy a Bluetooth hands-free headset for while I am driving.  I cannot afford to miss calls, and being in radio, when not at work or home I can be found in my car monitoring the radio virtually 100% of the time and unfortunately this means I sometimes cannot hear the ringer.  The tethered device that came with the phone is certainly loud enough, but simply did not fit my ear (it kept falling out).  I bought a replacement that came with a variable size adapter and yet while it FIT better, the sound was almost impossible to hear (the worst I have ever experienced, actually).  So I took the plunge knowing full-well that the Palm Treo has a somewhat problematic history using these devices...so I made sure that I had an iron-clad return policy in place and jumped in.  It took me no more than a minute to configure my head-set and I went ahead and made a test call which had more than enough volume -- in fact it had plenty to spare.  All in all I am VERY satisfied with the performance. (I bought a Keycera Bluetooth, if that means anything)One additional item that requires mentioning: I currently have call-waiting as a service with my Treo and yet I have missed at least 3 calls (that I know of).  This particular feature does not seem to be supported by the 650...and IF it is, I have yet to discover any useful info regarding the problem, whether online or in the bible-sized instruction manual.  I will keep looking and IF I find a solution I will quickly report it here asap.  Just one more thing to think about.  Otherwise, I am amazingly satisfied with my Treo otherwise.  The ONLY thing I wish (other than user-friendly call-waiting) is faster downloads while online.  That is supposedly possible with the newer models using EVDO and yet the 700p I tested failed to work only slightly faster than my 650.  Maybe it was the network -- but not according to them (no surprise there).  I still think my purchase was WELL worth it.","5.0","Everything I had hoped it would be...so far anyway...","1170028800","01 29, 2007"

I switched to BlackBerry two years ago (7290) and I've enjoyed using it except for the very, very basic screen. I assume that's how they get such remarkable battery life. But, I've had to switch from the BB for work reasons and I'm very happily using Palm again. My last Palm was a Palm Vx and it's still alive and kicking after many, many years.The Treo 650's screen is really amazing. And, I've read the older reviews about the Treo 650 and the frequent resetting issue. I was certainly concerned and ready to send it back if I had problems (Cingular gives you 30 days to try it out). So far only one reset in two weeks with the Palm - honestly, I had to reset the BlackBerry constantly so I'm not sure I'd notice the difference. And, the BB resets are particularly annoying because they would happen at the start of answering incoming calls and then literally take 5-8 minutes to reset and let me use it again. I'm not sure why it took so long - I did have a big address book. The Palm reset only took 30 seconds.But, here's where Treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s and videos. I can put 2-4 movies on a 2GB SD card, pop into the Palm and carry around some convenient entertainment. One little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically (it's longer that way). With letterbox movies it really increases the size of the video and exceeds the size of videos on my Zen Vision 30GB screen. And, the videos really look incredible.And, of course, there's a ton of free software out there for the Palm. So far, I've only downloaded TCPMP for the movies. The included RealPlayer is very impressive - you're ready to listen to mp3s right out of the box.Final note: I've used the Palm Desktop for PIM stuff (contacts, calendar, to do's) off and on for years and I'm still impressed with it's features and easy/quick navigation. They've always been ahead of the pack - I know many of the newer phones come with similar PIM software so your PC can talk to your new phone but aside from BlackBerry no one else is even in the ballpark.You can manage photos in there as well and even add photos to your address book so once you've synced up your incoming calls display a picture of the caller. I know this has been around for a while but it wasn't available on my old Palm V or the new BlackBerry I've been using for the past few years.","5.0","Two Weeks...Already Can't Live Without It","1173139200","03 6, 2007"

Thiel","[8, 8]","I've only been using mine a couple of weeks, but have been using both Palmpilots and cell phones for years--and should mention that I lived in Japan for seven years, where the functions of the Treo would be considered very basic and even far outdated with the notable exception that you can add software and therefore functionality to the Treo.Despite what I would consider the low resolution of the camera and screen, the slow speed performance over the wireless network (apparrently the later models of Treo are broadband speed now), and the fact that Palm Software basically came out with a set of winners back in the 1990s and never improved notably, don't let the critical attitude I write this review in deceive you.  I love this thing.  It's perfect for me and my needs--personally, as well as in business.-New batteries and accessories are and will be available for years following your purchase, which means this has it all over other cell phones.-When you upgrade, all your data is transferrable even if you completely change carriers.-One program I added for instance is basically Google Earth--in my pocket!  And with memory cards in the gigabytes, I can add any and as much functionality as I care to have--plus store all my rediculous photos and other nonsense without worrying about running out of space.-I'll be using this as my mp3 player, and it's a camera that will be there even when I wouldn't have thought to bring one.-It holds all my appointments, vital information, etc . . . .-It has advantages over the super Japanese cell phones and system in that I can take longer movies and send them by regular e-mail.-When negotiating business over lunch or golf, where it would be a weak hand to bring a stack of papers or notes, you can input and look up information as need be in this device you would be expected to carry instead.-Add that I can basically use as many e-mail accounts on it as I like.This basically negates whatever need I had to carry a laptop unless I'm on an extended business trip.This is truly a computer with internet access in my pocket.  It can do all the same basic stuff a desktop computer can do.I'm only taking one star away because there are now later models even more capable, and if you're considering buying the 650 you might as well get it with faster internet access.Note that friends of mine with the 700w as opposed to the 700p say they miss the Palm native software and some have said they'll switch to the 700p to get it--so it's something to consider if you're thinking of going a step above the 650.Lastly, though I do find this increadibly handy, I don't know that it's worth the asking price that's usually listed.  If a cell phone of any kind is connected to a service, the most it should cost the customer is $200 with a service contract.  There's really no excuse for charging people $500 for any phone (and I wouldn't have bought mine if it didn't cost me exactly $75 used).  They're selling you a service and making you sign a contract that they'll charge you big time for breaking, so they should take the additional expense when it comes to equiptment for for accessing services they're going to charge you or your company through the nose for anyway.Cingular is currently selling these for $45 with a service contract, and I would take that deal if I weren't able to get mine for a reasonable price.  Conversely, I'd rather not have one issued by my company because that would leave me not a moment's privacy (people I have important business with know when it's appropriate to reach me by means other than my office phone or e-mail, and when it's not.)","4.0","An increadibly all inclusive device for people who need a lot but don't want to carry a lot.","1160870400","10 15, 2006"

The very mixed, sometimes extreme, reviews of the 650 and the relatively high price for an unlocked Treo kept me away. With the release of the next generation of Treos drmatically forcing down the price of the 650 I decided to take a chance. After a week of fairly active use I have to say that I am extremely pleased with my new Treo. I bought my new unlocked (Cingular branded) Treo online. The phone clarity is as good as any mobile phone that I have owned. I have not had any dropped calls. The browswer and e-mail client that came loaded on my Treo work well. I live in a country where the fastest mobile data connection is still GPRS/EDGE, so my Tro 650 is just right. I easily synced my Treo with my MacBook with no problems.

I didn't change it out right away as when I put my old sim card in my new phone it worked.  But then, a few weeks later, I tried to add a data feature to my phone from the AT&T; website and I had some problems.  The data feature wouldn't add.  When I called AT&T;, they figured it was because I was still using my old sim card, so I put the new card in at that time and everything worked ok from then on.I'm guessing (and I'm really just guessing here...) that along with other things that the new sim card does, it also somehow allows AT&T; to make sure that the folks that have phones that MUST use a $30 data package GET a $30 data package.  This is totally a guess on my end, but that was the feeling I got from customer service when I called.Made me wonder if a used iPhone would work on the network and if using an old sim card if you would not HAVE to get the data package from AT&T.;  Of course, then you would be limited to connecting to a wireless connection (like a computer) for email and internet, but then not everyone needs email and the internet all the time. But, maybe this would be cheating AT&T;?  If you buy an iPhone used and connect over AT&T;, are you contracted to use the $30 data package no matter what?Anyway, I'm sure I'm missing data here, because this is not very clear, but I thought it was interesting...

I received  this one as a gift from my friend and love it for two simple reasons:1) The sound quality is excellent. Despite the fact that it is very noisy in my car when I drive on the highway, I still can hear excellent. I actually do reduce volume on the headset because it has more volume potential than I need. I tried two headsets by Motorola in the past, including HS850. They also have volume button but even when you set to the maximum volume you can't hear well if you in a noisy environment. Plantronics provide you great quality and enough volume for any noisy environment. Also, everyone whom I talked to, told me that they can hear me very well, just like I speak without the headset.2) Reason number two - it sits perfectly on the ear. It is easy to insert it when you drive, and once it in, it stays there. It doesn't move at all. Unlike Motorola headset, that does not fall off but it moves on your ear and it takes a long time to get used to the fact that it is not falling off your ear. Plantronics also provides three different sizes of the pieces that you insert to your ear, makes it perfect to fit any size or shape.That is all I have to say. There is a good headset out there.

Maybe mine was defective, I'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth.  In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.I found a different headset at 73% off but still $40 (orig $150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold) and it comes with its own chargeable case. Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges!  Other colors are a bit more. Check that one out if you wear glasses.

Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from all windows up and driver/passenger window down.HOWEVER.... I wear glasses and have a rounder face.  It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on.  The bulky part doesn't sit well on my glasses' frame.  The mouthpiece is not adjustable.  I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face.  Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same.  The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving.  The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit.  I turn it on before I place it on my ear.  Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame. I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update.

Also, he said that it was too bulky for his liking, but I like it just fine!The sound quality is great, I can hear others well and I'm told that I come through very clearly.

The volume level is good for me, and I have hearing loss, so that's impressive as well. The contols are easy to use. I'm using this with an older MOT V330. Highly recommended for both the performance and price. Oh, contrary to another reviewers suggestion, it will not fit into a mint tin due to it's width. I haven't found a good hard-case solution for it yet.Update on 8/16/08:I thought I lost my 510, so after reviewing all the newer units, I bought another one! The newer models appear to be riddled with minor bugs & issues, so why not stick with a winner? I'm now using this with my T-Mobile Dash and it works great for the voice command features. My office was trying to decide on which model to go with, so we ordered up a half a dozen latest models of headsets. I added my own to the evaluation pool. After two weeks of testing, almost everyone liked the 510 better than all the rest, so we ordered up 20 of them! If this model was discontinued and I needed a new headset, I'd go with the latest jawbone; which worked fine, had better wind resistance, but didn't have quite the all-day comfort or inherent design durability of the 510. Hope this helps!","5.0","It actually works! Now that is something to be said for Bluetooth!","1178928000","05 12, 2007"

My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly.

"A2GYQ4GLWE7LMY","B0009B0IX4","BB","[1, 1]","I've only had this unit for about 24 hours, but I really like it.  These are my initial impressions, and I compare this to the Motorola H680 as overall about equal, very similar to the findings by a major consumer-oriented organization as to these two Bluetooths.I gave my used H680 away to a friend of mine because she was driving me crazy always speaking to me over her speaker phone while driving.  She used the speaker phone out of necessity because in California you can not put the phone to your ear while driving, and her bluetooth's battery had died.  My friend is not mechanically adept and I would've kept the H680 otherwise.  It is smaller and more convenient to use than this Plantronics, but I feel the sound quality with this unit is better.  This unit takes some adjustment so I hope the following comments will be of benefit to those of you who purchase this unit:1.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.2.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.3.  Once you have thoroughly read the instruction booklet (it's not lengthy) and you get past setting it for your left ear (if that is your desire), the only major thing to do is to determine which of the three eartips is best for you.  This is important for comfort and I suggest that you start with the smallest tip and work your way up.  I am using the smallest tip-it works best for me.Though the unit appears to be somewhat awkward looking, it really is not uncomfortable on the ear if you accustom yourself to placing the eartip comfortably in your ear first (contrary to the booklet and as if the unit did not contain the curved attachment)-the rest will follow.Sound is crisper than with the H680, and appears louder.You can't go wrong with either, but I think I like this one more.Update:  1/7/10  Sound is definitely better with this unit, and it appears to hold charge longer than H680.  Voyager is definitely larger than H680.  When you get past that, and realize the benefits of sound quality and longer use on a charge, you might favor, as I do, the Voyager 510.  It's quite enjoyable not to have to repeat myself when transmitting - no one on receiving end has complained about poor sound quality!","4.0","Initial impressions of this unit","1259712000","12 2, 2009"

More like 3 right off the charger. This is a problem. Now I need a car charger for it.* Too many buttons and not intuitive. Not responsive sometimes to commands. Sluggish switching.* The ear pieces cost you a certain amount of ambient hearing of your environment. Whatever size you use, it still really cuts down on your hearing of the world around you on that side. Compared to the floppy Motorola, this is extreme.

"ATVGOLUVAS6XY","B0009B0IX4","Bubba &amp; Squiggles' Dad Sai","[0, 0]","I got this because I used Plantronics headsets at work and love the quality + the price was awesome. This solves the main purpose of the bluetooth - to enable handsfree conversation with quality audio. The voice quality is very good - people hear me very clearly and I too hear them clearly (at times, the volume seems to be a bit low but I do not know if it is because the other side is not speaking close into the phone or it is a problem with this). Pairing with the iPhone was a breeze. You can pair with 2 devices at the same time (I tried 2 phones, but I would like to add a phone and my laptop so I can take softphone calls on my laptop without an extended headset).I noticed that it disconnects from the phone after some time (less than an hour) of non-use. The first few days, I was always powering it off and on to re-establish the connection or going to the phone settings to reconnect and I was going to return it; however, one day I wanted to try pressing and holding the talk button for 2 seconds and bingo - it reconnects. So I don't have to power it off/on to reconnect.I am not sure if this is a feature of the iPhone or this device but I love the Voice Control - I press the talk button for 2 seconds to activate the Voice Control on my iPhone and I can say the number or name I want to dial and it dials for me. So now I am 100% hands-free while driving I use voice control all the time to dial people.I gave a 4 rating because this is not as comfortable as the Motorola H720 that I got for my wife (H720 is true over the ear headset - nothing going into your ear - you can read my review for that product on Amazon). Getting on the ear is a bit difficult - need 2 hands usually.For folks that want to listen to music from your iPhone/BBerry, please note that this headset is NOT A2DP enabled. i.e. you cannot stream music to your headset from your smartphone. If that is important for you, you can try Jabra BT8040 (I owned 8010 until I lost it, and I liked that - Plantronics or Motorola H720 voice quality was better than my old 8010 though).","4.0","Good headset, thought not as comfortable as Motorola H720","1286236800","10 5, 2010"

The battery life is wonderful usually outlasting a phone charge by a factor of two. It is generally compatible with just about all the regular phones.  If you have a Palm OS phone, pick a different headset as this MAY work, but has some issues that I find are difficult to live with.The good: This is a very durable headset (mine went through the washer and dryer and still works after it dried out for a few days).  The multiple options for ear pieces, flexibility of the design (switching ears without carrying extra accessories), compatibility with lots of phones, antenna design solving cross body communications for some phones, charging options with USB and power (you can wear it while charging comfortably), and battery life all are great. It connects to 2 devices at a time though you can obviously only answer one of them at a time.The Bad: (all minor) The wind smart does not work that great.  I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that can handle direct wind noise and this is no exception. It does better than most but remote parties still complain. Every headset I have tested fails here. This is difficult to distinguish between mute on the headset and power off. I tuned it off a few times on accident when trying to mute.  Oops. The mute also does not alert you frequently enough that it is on, but you can still mute from the phone separately without issues.  Pairing is simple, but not just a one button option.I would suggest this headset to users looking for a good headset for most devices.

I would like to comment on the things I didn't see a lot of before I purchased.1.  Talk time: I'm on the phone 3000 to 5000 minutes per month as a Director of Business Development.  About 6 hours per day talk time is all you get.  Not good, not bad, pretty much on par with the other 3 BT Headsets I've owned. I will say that it seems this unit charges more quickly than the other I've owned.2.  I wear Glasses:  It fits Ok with them. The only problem comes when you remove your glasses with the Headset on; the Headset is prone to fly off. I can tell you that the unit is durable after several such flights.3.  Comfort:  I'm a big guy, 285 lbs.  Comfort didn't come quickly for me.  I still need to change ears a couple of times a day.  However, after around 30 days it is much better and I expect one day I'll not even know it is there.4.  Sound:  Good most of the time.  Better than the others I've owned.  Loud.  If you drive the highway this one works well.  Background noise is reduced but not eliminated; and unlike another background reducing Headset I own (from Plantronics also) there is no delay on call pick-up... nice!5.  Props to Plantronics.  By pressing the volume + key as you turn the unit on, the blinking blue light gets turned off (and on), this is important to me because people look like Cyborgs walking around blue blinking in public (not professional at all).6. On/Off:  I thought it would be a problem after the things I read.  I have big fingers.  Not a problem; maybe they enhance it some from older models.That's it; mostly all good except comfort which seems to be coming around.","4.0","Things & Stuff","1181865600","06 15, 2007"

However, depending on how you plan to use it, it could either become a great headset or a nightmare.The first thing you notice out of the box is that it's quite large, both in the size of the battery pack that hangs over your ear and especially the depth of the microphone.  Put another way, it sticks out quite a bit from your cheek rather than laying flat against your face.  This not only can cause some sound quality issues, but also makes it very conspicuous.  So, if you prefer to keep a low profile while working hands-free, this may not be the best one for you.  The size of the piece that hangs over your ear also makes wearing glasses or even a hat an issue.  All that said, the unit is very comfortable provided you don't have anything else hooked over your ear.  It's also easily configured for either ear.Sound quality can be very good, but only in quiet environments.  Even small amounts of wind noise will render the microphone useless.  I've been surprised to have people complain to me that voicemails that I've left have been all broken up, even when I was in what I thought was a quiet place.I've also found that reception will be spotty unless the phone is placed closer than normal to the headset.  For instance, in order to maintain good signal, I typically have to have my phone in my shirt pocket.  But on the plus side, the unit is very easy to set up, with a variety of phones and PDAs immediately connecting to it with no effort.This headset would be ideal for someone who is looking to use it exclusively in an indoor office while working hands-free.  You'd get optimal sound and would be able to connect to all of your devices quickly and easily.  You wouldn't even feel self-conscious about the unit's size.  But for those on the go, its reception and microphone quality are too poor to recommend.PROS*  Excellent battery life means very little downtime for charging*  Simple to set up - instantly compatible with numerous devicesCONS*  Sound quality from the microphone, especially in places with even minimal background noise*  Big, bulky design makes fit difficult, especially with glasses or a hat","3.0","Functional for the Right User, but Far From Perfect for All","1158019200","09 12, 2006"
"A97R2RMCBRVTY","B0009B0IX4","DrZ","[0, 0]","This little ugly-ish set is still ruling the market with great sound quality for both its owners and people they talk to.  I have owned or tested several supposedly great Bluetooth sets with several different phones and devices including iPhone 3G, Motorola Razr and L6, Blackberry 7100i, two different laptops (Skype) and Playstation 3, and no other headset performed as well as Plantronics Voyager 510.In parallel with this device I had three different Jabras including BT250, BT500 and JX10 and neither one comes close to the sound quality and wind tolerance of Voyager 510.  I also learned of a number of users including my boss who switched from Jawbone 1 AND 2 to this or Discovery 925 set due to fit, comfort and sound issues, so I never even bothered to buy a Jawbone.  With Plantronics Voyager 510, people I talk to can't even tell I'm using a Bluetooth headset; not even when I'm driving, which I find amazing.  Since it's been over four years in my never ending quest for the perfect Bluetooth headset that I constantly keep researching and reverting to this little mule, I just have to give it five stars in spite of its mainly cosmetic flaws.Here's why I got to appreciate this somewhat clumsy set so much:1. Good output volume and quality. When I'm using Plantronics Voyager 510, people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a cell phone with a Bluetooth headset - not even when I'm driving (windows closed). The case was the opposite when I was using Jabras, when I used to hear complaints about noise, static and low volume of my voice.2. Good and controllable earphone volume. It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I'm walking outside my downtown Chicago office. I can set the volume really loud, so the only case when I cannot hear my partner is when I'm walking too close to a moving train. My usual volume setting is around 1/3.3. This set's microphone tolerates wind better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.4. Good battery life. I don't have to charge it often.5. Although it seems very light and gentle in my hands, it handles everyday folding and switching between my shirt pocket and both my ears very well.6. No problems with long usage, unlike Jabra BT250, which used to irritate the skin on the back of my ear if I used it too long or too often.I never heard about Plantronics before buying this headset and I grew to appreciate it a lot more after years of usage. Only recently I discovered that Plantronics has a long history with headsets and that even the Apollo missions used their headsets on the Moon. Makes sense. One small set for man, one giant leap away from other BT headsets. Houston, we have no problem.","5.0","Great after over 3 years of (ab)use","1224720000","10 23, 2008"

I've talked 3 or 4 hours some days, and had it on all day when I'm not talking, and have never run the battery down. I do charge it when I get home each evening.

It connects quickly and works great. Sometimes it seems a bit hard to get on, but other times it just slips into place.

I've owned 4 over the last year; a Jabra, a Motorola, this one and another Plantronics. And I've used several different ones over time in the testing process, and this is easily the best I've used. The earlier Plantronics was also very good as well. The Jabra didn't have very good noise-reduction and the Motorola was a terrible purchase altogether. But this headset I can say with ease is superb. Great sound, it picks up very little in the way of ambient noise, and the charge lasts forever, seemingly!UPDATE: When I originally purchased this device over 2 years ago, I di have to replace it back in July. Why? Because I had it in a messenger bag that got stepped on. I used it just about every day, and the only reason I had to get a new headset is because it was physically damaged. Guess which headset I got to replace it? THE SAME ONE!

"A3F3B6HY9RJI04","B0009B0IX4","James Duckett","[15, 15]","I first bought a headset for $30.  It worked well for about 10 (maybe 12) minutes and then fell apart.  So, I would not suggest considering anything under $100.Unless you consider this one.When I returned my first headset to Fry's Electronics I asked them what their most popular model was.  The sales guy said it was the Plantronics 510.  I tried it on and it felt really good.  I've been using it for about two months now and I love it to pieces.  It works as well now as it did the moment I bought it (actually, better, because it needed a charging).Positives:1)  Comfort.  This was the biggest attribute I was looking for as I wear this a lot.  After putting it on I usually forget it is there within two minutes.  It is light weight and very easy on the ears.  I only remember when somebody calls me and I hear the beeping in my ears.  With a flick of the wrist, this easily converts between the left and right ear and both feel extremely comfortable.2)  Sturdy.  I travel a lot and airports are not kind to any belongings, especially ones crammed into a bag.  But this thing has taken its lickings and keeps on going.  Must better than the first one I bought which fell apart over nothing.3)  Great sound quality.  I've used this at airports, casinos, and convention centers.  I can always hear my party without any problems and I've never had anybody complain that they can't hear me.4)  Simple to work.  Probably the most difficult thing about this is getting it recognized by the phone.  And that isn't complicated at all as that only took me 2 minutes, and most of that was searching for directions on how to do it.  Picking up the phone is as easy as hitting a button.On a side note, I have two Bluetooth cellphones and I can switch between the two automatically without any hassle.  Because of this ease of switching over I am considering getting the phone base so I can use this on my office line at home as well.  I know somebody who uses it and she has no problems with it.Negatives:1)  I wish there was a way to turn off the blinking blue light.  It drives me crazy especially while driving at night.  Half the times I see it blink I think  I'm getting pulled over.  Also, it keeps blinking whether you are using it or not so I usually cover it with a hand towel when it is charging at night.  But this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth device.2)  Ummmm.... I can't think of any other negatives.So, I highly suggest checking this one out.  I can't say that this is for everybody because I've learned that no two ears are exactly alike.  The biggest thing I was looking for was comfort.  While this is completely comfortable for me it might not be for you.  But if you find it comfortable then I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up over anything else especially since the price is soooo right.","5.0","Highest Recommendation","1165449600","12 7, 2006"

Unfortunately, hers die within 2 months with very light use. And, I mean 'light' -- it spent most of its life sitting on her nightstand.

"A1HFQ2FKCXYME1","B0009B0IX4","Jeff Richardson","[2, 2]","I've used the Plantronics Voyager 510 for a few months and have been quite satisfied with the length of the battery charge, reception, volume, and ability for others to hear me speak clearly.  The size of the headset is large compared to other headsets on the market and this is the only downside to this item.  Other headsets may look sleek, chic, or more cool, but if good earpiece volume and clear transmission of your voice is critical, this is the headpiece for you.  If the size of the headset the goes behind the ear was slightly slimmer, I'd give it a full five stars.  The interchangeable earbuds are somewhat tricky to remove once installed.  That's the only other downside to this unit.  Otherwise, a great headset.  I enjoy mine a great deal.Update to my previous review (August 2010): After using this headset for over two years, I'm still fairly satisfied.  The only problems I've had was one of the earbuds was broken off after I mistakenly put the earpiece in my briefcase with several items the pressed against it.  Fortunately, there are two other earbuds included with the headset and I easily replaced the broken one.  Also, after a period of time, I've noticed the foam cover for the earbuds tends to split at the seam.  If you're purchasing this headset for the first time, it may be worth your money to buy and extra earbud/foam covers set.  Another problem is the headset momentarily disconnecting with my cell phone, then connecting back.  At this time, I don't know whether that is a result of problems with the headset or the phone.  Otherwise, it has served me well and I've yet to have had anyone tell me that my voice was difficult to hear or understand while conversing in a variety of noisy conditions.  Considering how long I've used this headset and it's performance to date, I can still recommend it to potential buyers.Another update to my previous review (September, 2010).  Since my last update, another issue has arisen with this headset.  The rubber material that houses the wiring and is the part that bends over your ear, has cracked in two areas.  One is closer to the top (near the on/off switch), the other is at the end of the rubber tube just above the earpiece.  At the latter location, the rubber is literally crumbling to pieces and exposing the wire cord within.  This is a very recent development and seems to be a part of decay based on age.  I realize after 2 1/2 years that no Bluetooth headset will look like new, but if this deterioration keeps up, a significant portion of the wire that runs from the battery to the earpiece/mic will be exposed.  When taking the construction into consideration, there's no way to replace this portion of the headset.  Short of wrapping the rubber in electrical tape (which would only give an unsightly and temporary fix), the only other solution is buying another one.  But, that doesn't make sense since the item is still in perfect working order, has a great earpiece with clear sound, and I've yet to have anyone complain about the quality of my voice through the mic, even when I was in a noisy environment.Final update to two previous updates (September, 2010).  The problem I wrote about in my last update has made me decide to never consider this model again.  The rubber portion that fits over my ear literally crumbled into several pieces two days ago.  Not only did this make the earpiece useless, but the wiring broke off from the circuit board that's in the piece that goes behind your ear.  Long story short, don't buy this model and expect to get several years of use.  If you're lucky and VERY careful in the way you carry, store, & use this item, you'll be lucky to get two years of use out of it.  Otherwise, I can't recommend it since there are so many other models that are equal to or better for less money.  I'll generously give it three stars...was tempted to give it only two, but the boom mic is an asset...noise reduction is better than average...but that's about all.","3.0","Big in size, good performance, bad in long term use.","1209772800","05 3, 2008"

Though it looks heavy, the unit is a featherweight and fits nicely around the ear. Long-term wearing is comfortable. Audio fidelity is excellent.Where the unit fails badly, though, is the controls. They do not provide enough tactile input. You cannot be certain of where the volume control is or which end of the rocker switch increases or decreases the volume. Since the volume defaults to moderately low setting, this means you are likely to miss the first words of whatever your caller is saying which in turn means a lot of asking what did you say?.The Call Control button handles at least four different functions. On a phone equipped to handle all four functions, it is easy to mistakenly select a function. For example, on my phone, if I hold the Call Control button a fraction too long, the call is not answered, but the prompt to enter a Voice Speed Dial entry is actuated. No fun when you are trying to answer a call.Plantronics provides three earpiece inserts and it's unlikely that one of them won't provide a comfortable, snug fit.Overall, excellent technology marred by poor ergonomics.Jerry","3.0","Poor ergonomics mar this otherwise excellent Bluetooth headset","1173830400","03 14, 2007"

I love it!! Skype call comes in, and the headset rings - call comes in on the Treo 650 and the headset rings. What's not to like???I love the fit too - I think it's the best I've tried on. I also have the Scala 700x which is about as light you could imagine in a headset. But, it's almost a little too light (and fragile). Honestly, I like them both but need to have a backup. Now that I think of it, I believe my wife just inherited a Scala 700x.The 510 feels like it's built to take some abuse which I think is a plus and yet it's lighter than I expected - to be honest. It's been around for a little while so I was afraid it might be a little heavy. I'm pleasantly surprised that it's very light.

If you are reading this review because you are shopping for a new Bluetooth headset, just go ahead and finishing reading the next couple sentences and then you can do what I did... buy the Plantronics Voyager 510 at Amazon (for under $45.00 as of this review).  I own 10 different headsets and have used them all to make hundreds of calls in all types of environments, and since we can only really rate products on a curve, there is currently no better choice at this time (things will no doubt change one day).  It is the most stable, the most ergonomic, the most static free (there is no such thing as a completely static free wireless product), the most efficient with it's battery usage, most comfortable (a somewhat subjective attribute), the most bang for the buck, the most satisfying to use, and the most 5 star rated Bluetooth Headset money can buy.  I can only really complain about one thing... a very sensitive microphone that will pick up wind noise in moderately windy conditions (in spite of the noise cancelling technology), but this is certainly true with every headset that I have used and probably true with ALL headsets when you come down to it.","5.0","Wow...

I can't use it outside if there is any wind current, and even the air currents from my car's AC or heat are too much for it.2) Most disappointingly, the microphone boom cracked in half after about 60 days.  I am working with Plantronics' warranty department, but they need a date code, which is unreadable without a magnifying glass.  I will update once I have some resolution.3) This device only works for the Ericsson's phone functions, not music, because the Walkman music functions use the A2DP Bluetooth protocol, and the 510 is not A2DP compatible.  (Yes, listening to music with just one earpiece could be lame, but I would love to have podcasts on my phone).  For A2DP, you need something like the Jabra 8010 or 8040.4) Contrary to some reviewers, I didn't have any problem using this with glasses.

"AE0BMVEVVU6DQ","B0009B0IX4","jp2code Joe Pool to Code .NET","[1, 1]","I am a moderate user, and this device will be charged long enough for me to go Monday through Friday at work.At work, I can have my cell phone (Motorola V365) connected via Bluetooth and setting up high enough that it can pick up a decent signal while I am moving around in poor signal areas. Further, I keep my phone's ringer on 'silent' so coworkers don't know when I receive a phone call. The headset simply beeps in my ear, and I click it to take the call. If I am in a meeting or the boss is talking to me, I simply let it beep in my ear 4 or 5 times until the call goes to voicemail. No one even knows I had a call coming! If I am on the phone and someone important walks up to say something, I can easily stop responding to the person on my headset. They get the point pretty quickly, because they can hear the person I am talking to just about as clearly as I can!Now, if you want a nice quiet conversation in a cubical, you can scoot up close to a flat object (I use my flatscreen monitor) and talk in a very low voice. The sound reflects off of the monitor, so it is easier for your caller to hear your low voice volume without cupping your hand over your mouth piece or without trying to hold the mouth piece closer to your lips.I liked this so much I bought one for my wife. Her older phone (Motorola V557) drops the bluetooth signal much more often than mine does. Also, she goes outside more often than I do, and it seems like sunlight interferes with the bluetooth radio frequency. My wife loves keeping her phone on silent with the headset, because this way the baby doesn't wake up whenever a phone call comes in. My wife's complaint is that the signal gets dropped a lot, but she sometimes leaves the phone in the living room whenever she makes a quick trip to the bedroom - and that's just too far away.Next, I bought one for my dad. But, he's one of those old timers that will never change. I can't seem to get him to put one of these 'new fangled things' on his ear.

This can be a problem for ears that lie close to the head - the earhook pushes the ear away from the head. First, this does create a rather odd looking mismatched pair of ears! Second, it can become uncomfortable after prolonged use. It also poses a problem when wearing eyeglasses - one temple rests on top of the headset ear hook with the other at ear height. This causes the eyeglasses to rest lop-sided. So, buyer beware. The sound quality is great.

It is easy to use and works very good when wind exposure is low. With the increase in wind your voice is sometimes distorted and the person at the other end gets intermittent breakup of your voice. This happens with all Bluetooth headsets but less with this one. You can eliminate this problem by cupping your hand over the mic while talking. This blocks the wind from the mic! It is comfortable if you don't mind the loop part that goes over your ears. The bigger the ear lobe the easier it will stay on your ears and feel comfortable. I have moderate size ear lobes and it feels OK over my ear but takes time to adjust to feel comfortable. But it is about the best bluetooth out there.

Let me just say that my prior favorite was the Logitech but it was a little bulky and it disconnected from my phone after most calls (annoying).Having said that I now enjoy Plantronics Voyager 510.  The higher model, Discovery 640 doesn't stand a chance.  Yes the 640 is smaller, cooler-looking, but the features are not good.  The 640 has no windguard, no noice-cancelling tech, and the talk time is short.  The extra battery charger they give you and try to say that it boosts talk time does not.  You can't talk and charge at the same time.  Sheesh.OKay, so now with the Voyager 510, I love it.  Great fit.  It seems Plantronics has come out with a new version of the 510.  The foam mic boom is not removeable but is built in much like the logitech is.  The voice and sound quality are top notch.  I've recorded myself and it sounds clear.  I can even notice a difference with the noise-cancelling technology as the tv was on in the background, but my voice was still clear.  Noice-cancelling is important.Pros:Clear, audible soundMic is sensitive and my voice for callers are clearWind-GuardNoise-Cancelling technology (must have!)Fit - stays on confortably and they give 3 earphone-like inserts (perfect)Cons:the only thing is that the mic boom seems to rub up on my cheek or is very close so sometimes it will make a scratching sound for the caller (since it's rubbing against my cheek).

It is surprisingly comfortable considering the girth of the piece that goes over and behind the ear. My past headsets with earloops were horribly painful after a very short time, this one I can wear for hours, barely noticing it. It came with 3 different earpieces - one small, one large, and one teardrop shaped - so fit was not a problem. Sound quality is good enough that people frequently comment on how clear I sound and I am nearly always using it in the car. Wind cancellation really is insufficient, but this has not been a major issue for me...I just use it with the windows up or mostly up. I frequently leave this thing on overnight and still use it for a couple of days afterwards with no loss of power. Talk time is at least the 6 hours claimed and stand-by time can be measured in days.  Some people are troubled by the proprietary power cord, but it's a small matter as I have a household-type plug in my car and charge it while driving if need be, though it cannot be charged and used simultaneously.  I came here to see if I wanted to upgrade to another Plantronics model and pass this headset on to my daughter, but I think I'm going to keep it and buy her the same model.UPDATE:Still a 5 star item and I am on my second one.  After 2.5 years the first one broke at the top of the earloop.

I emailed the company explaining I bought it from Amazon and mentioned it is within the warranty period. I did not hear anything for about a week, and then, a replacement appeared at my house, sent via express mail. It is a refurb, but that is their condition, and it looks and works perfectly. Awesome customer service. Just one more reason to get this product!I have used this for a month, and I love it. I have been searching for a decent bluetooth headset, and after using it for about a month, I can tell you it is great. The sound is very good and clear. I have no complaints from anyone I speak with, and usually they don't even know I am using a headset. There are only two negatives, and they really are not that bad. First, turning it on and off is not easy. That is not really a bad thing, but it is a little awkward. My second complaint would take off half a star, and that is, my usb car charger cannot work with it, and I had to buy a seperate charger. It is much easier to answer and hang up, when compared to others I have used. It is VERY comfortable, and I sometimes forget that I am wearing it., as witnessed by my wife who often reminds me tha tI am still wearing it. I bought this because my wife's set died and she needed a new one. Ehem, it seems that I somehow ended up with this one and she got my old piece of &$#%(@ (insert your guess of brand here) because she was used to it. Well, she now has her own and loves it as well, though she also complains about the on/off button. I should also note that my Verizon Razor, which often would not recognize the Verizon blue tooth headset I had, has no problem QUICKLY hooking up with this headset. I really love it and would recommend it to anyone. Lastly, the battery life is very good.","5.0","I wish I bought this sooner!","1204588800","03 4, 2008"

The only reason I had to get my second one was because my dog chewed it up, then I backed over my second one with my car in the driveway, so I bought the third. Thinking I was still getthing the exact same quality as before I wanted to stick with what I knew. I connected it to multiple bt compatible devices with ease... PS3, iPod Touch, iPhone, Blackberry, etc. All three times I purchased this product it ran no more than $30, but since they've redesigned it the quality has gone down & the price has increased to what you see now. I especially liked the fact that it had three different ear buds to accustom its users, but the part that went around the ear became annoying at times. Pending on what you're doing cut I'd be cleanin & sweating & it wouldn't hold firm. Same thing if I walked outside (Note that I'm in Tx,so it's very humid) the ear piece would come out. Btw, my third one is getting trashed because people can no longer hear me clearly and I only had this one for about 4 months.

This does just that and it does it remarkably well.Although you cannot switch while in a conversation very easily (you have to hold the call button until it beeps twice to release the call to the phone mic/speaker and then could pick up the call, but have no easy way to switch back), it handles the obvious uses well. If one phone starts ringing, the headset correctly selects it so you can pick up the call - perfect.The headset is comfortable for very long calls, with a good balance on the ear.The microphone stalk is not as movable as the product brief suggests, and it does not fold up per se (sticks out no matter where positioned). Folding up the mic does not power off, which is a shame, although the battery life seems really good.Sound quality is good on the speaker and appears to be good on the other end, although I have not heard the other side to know for sure.Only downside vs. the Jabra is that it does not have a USB charger (small cord to plug into laptop when traveling), so you have to drag along the transformer.","5.0","Perfect if you have two phones","1216771200","07 23, 2008"

I put over 5 hours of talk time on this device 5 days a week for well over a year.  I used it in a weekly 4 hour commute, during the day in the office, at night to talk to my family from the hotel and a number of other usages.  I know this device and using it is as familiar as turning on my blinker in the car.The Good:1. Great noise filtering.  The microphone does a great job of filtering out ambient noise including wind.2. The battery is excellent and lasts for days on standby and for at least 6 hours talking.3. Multipoint Technology.  This technology rocks.  I have both my work (Blackberry) and personal cell phone synched with this device at the same time and can call or answer either without pairing hassles.4. Pairs with a device that it has been setup with by simply pressing the primary button.5. Volume buttons on earpiece.6. Comes with multiple earpieces for comfort.7. Stable in the ear.  It doesn't feel as if it will fall out.8. Durable.  I used this hard for a few years and it has only now started to fall apart.  Still works though.9. Shares common power supply with many other Plantronics devices for ease of power sharing.10. Larger then competitors but very light.The Not so Good:1. It is bigger then most other devices.2. The earpieces are prone to fall out and don't stay secured after about 6 months.As you can see I really don't have much bad to say about this device.  I am only now replacing it after 2 years of use and that is because the earpiece fell out and I can't find the pack that came with it.  It still works!

"AXLEZROKSR2M2","B0009B0IX4","R. McKown","[1, 1]","The Plantronics Voyager 510 is a great headset for the right situation.  I've owned a 510 for three years, this latest one to replace the last one the dog chewed up (literally).The 510 is a comfortable headset with good battery life.  The quality of the audio I hear is very good, and the quality of the audio my callers hear is also very good.  However, the unit just returned would continuously send a low level static to callers, which wasn't the case with my prior 510.  I assume this was just a defective unit.The big strength of this headset is dealing with noise.  In comparison to the other two headsets I gave serious consideration, the Motorola H710 and the Jabra BT8040, the 510 had the best audio in all conditions.  One test was driving down the highway with all 4 windows down, the radio on at a moderate volume and the headset in the right ear.  Cabin noise was so loud that I felt the need to raise my voice level to hear myself.  I was able to hear callers over the noise just barely, and they could hear me, but did hear a lot of background noise as one would expect.  With the H710, I could hear callers well, but I was completely unintelligible to them.  The BT8040 was almost as good as the 510; callers heard me almost as well as with the 510, but I had trouble hearing callers because the audio was cutting in and out, as if echo cancellation was getting confused by all the noise.  All three worked quite well in quieter environments.  The H710 fails to cancel echo (of my voice back to me) when paired with a Uniden cordless land-line phone (with BT support).  The BT8040 fails to pair with the Uniden cordless phone at all.I ultimately kept the BT8040 and returned the 510 because of some shortcomings of the 510.  First, it is tricky to get on and off.  It took me a long time to figure out how to put it on using one hand, and it takes some fumbling.  It's far easier and faster to use 2 hands to put it on, but this is a hassle, and frankly looks stupid when you're doing it.  I don't like wearing it all the time because it is big and the darn blue light flashes all the time, grabbing the attention of others around you.  I feel like I'm on exhibit when I try to wear the 510 around others.  Finally, the 510 is not a good shape for keeping it in your pocket, and it's large enough that the phone and the headset in the same pocket isn't usually workable.  Which brings us back to the dog and the chewed up headset.  Because of its poor pocketability, I would tend to leave it on the desk or table when not in use.  Doggie finally figured this out.For use exclusively as a car or office headset, I'd pick the 510 over all three.  But for versatility in a wider range of uses, the BT8040 works best for me.","4.0","Strong performer with few weaknesses","1214956800","07 2, 2008"

I drive a very noisy construction van so background noise is a serious problem. I have compared 8 different headsets and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is the only one that allows a clear conversation in this environment. I have used it daily for over 2 years and often for 6+ hours straight until the battery is dead. In a loud, dirty, construction environment, often lying on the ground, it's the only thing I've found that works. With the other models, either I, the caller, or both of us couldn't understand a word being said. For those of you that don't have background noise issues, I can add that even in quiet settings this unit has better sound quality than all the others that I tested. The way that I do my tests is to pair 2 headsets, put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. This way I and the caller can compare the sound quality at almost the exact same time. The 2 cons I can mention are that the on/off button is too small and hard to push, and that when the battery is almost dead the buttons stop working (even though the sound continues fine) so you have to hang up using the phone instead of the headset. To be fair though, the almost dead battery symptoms happen in many of the other ones I've tested also. I don't care, sound is everything.","4.0","A Sound Review","1205020800","03 9, 2008"

The talk time is awesome and I have gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time out of the device.  The range isn't too bad I think I can get about 30 feet from my i870.  If only my crappy Nextel phone could keep up will the quality of the headset.  Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1/2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge.  However, while it's plugged in I can still use the 510 and wander all over the house and still talk on the phone.  It almost replaces the phone if I could dial from it.  The best part is that when you get too far away it gets a little static so that you know to come back closer and then the sound quality clears up.

Speaking with someone on a landline is pretty good clarity for them, they can tell if my window is open or not and if boom is too far from cheek they can hear alot of background noise. No matter who I talk to I can hear great every time.","4.0","Real nice","1216339200","07 18, 2008"

Insuffcient volume and insecure attachment to my ear.  Whenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off.  They never did but it was still annoying.  The volume problem was in part related to this.  The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I have been satisfied with my Plantronics 510.  The choice of 3 interchangable ear cushions, great volume, crisp output and decent range make it unbeatable.  The battery life is somewhat less that the motorola headsets, but I purchased an extra charger for home.  The power button is small, but using it is  a minor problem that resolves with a little practice.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The range is as good or better than the motorola sets.","5.0","Best Bluetooth headset I've used","1158537600","09 18, 2006"
"A3H5L0UHVTW3CS","B0009B0IX4","SoCal Amazonian","[11, 11]","I bought mine from Amazon cuz this was just about the lowest price I could find. Before I actually bought it I did some serious testing and reading about other headsets. I've tried Jabra 250, Jabra 500, Motorola HS850 and they all had one major problem - quite static-y. Actually the HS850 was a little better in this area than the Jabra headsets. I've had Jabra 250 for almost two years - static-y big time. If I put the phone in my left pant pocket and the headset on the right ear theres' noise all the time - this is not acceptable for me. The HS850, unlike the Jabra, has poor design. Any time I turn my head sharply this thing is flabbing on my ear as if it's going to fly out at any moment. This is why I wanted something better, not the same.I went on Amazon and read reviews on all kinds of headsets and my attention stopped on the Plantronics Voyager 510 from some company I'd never heard of. The the reviews were good. Even though my BestBuy store didn't carry it I decided to make the investment, buy it online and test it in the hopes to keep it.I received my headset, hooked it up to my phone - that was easy, no problem here.Then as soon as I started using it I noticed that there was no static, almost no static. I could keep my phone anywhere around me and there would be no static - a major advantage to the previous headsets.Then I noticed how easy it is to answer phone calls with it. the answer button is large enough, right against the ear, so I just had to press it against the ear using one finger. How cool is that?! The HS850 design was like that too but the Jabra 250 needed two fingers to answer one to support the headset and the other to press the answer button - I noticed with the new Jabra 500 that wasn't an issue anymore.The Plantronics is light, easy to put on, not flabby  - wraps around your ear pretty good.There's only a few things I didn't like about it and I hope the manufacturer is listening now:1. Picks up surrounding noise. If I am out people can hardly hear what I'm saying - even if there's hardly any wind. It's so bad that I've given up on using it outside.2. The ear bud needs to be tinier. I loved the small jelly-type of earpiece that Jabra had - you could hardly feel it in your ear.3. The power button is too tiny and hard to push. Not that this is a big deal because I hardly ever need to shut down my headset but it would be nice to have one that's larger still one that's not easy to hit by accident.I didn't give this review five stars because the headset needs to do a better job at fending off surrounding noise.Other than that, I highly recommend this headset. I have yet to see a headset that's as good as this one!","4.0","The best yet","1143244800","03 25, 2006"
"A26ITT1SYI2M80","B0009B0IX4","Stanley O. Chang stan1911","[6, 6]","My first BT headset was a Motorola HS850.  Worked well until the recharge plug snagged on the socket and parts of the socket came out with the power plug.  So I replaced it with the Plantronics 510.  I wanted an earpiece that inserted into my ear as oppose to laying on top of my ear like the old World War 2 headsets of 50 years ago.  I sometimes am in noisy environments and the lay on the ear type is not designed to isolate loud distracting noises.  The HS850 was difficult for me to hook over my ear and took both hands at times.  Not so with the Plantronics, at least for me.  It goes on my ear much easier and the earplug type earpiece shuts out more of the noisy world attempting to interrupt my communications.  The earplug type earpiece also provides vastly improved volume.  I had to crank up the MOT to full and still had trouble hearing it at times.  Remember, I'm not in an office cube with carpeting and noise absorbing fabric cubicle walls, but in my truck on the highway or on the plant floor.  The clarity of the sound is excellent.  The volume level is more than adequate for me with several levels left to crank up the volumn if I need to.The headset is bulkier than my self destructed HS850.  The recharge plug pushes in with a friction fit as opposed to Motorola's press to unlatch type power plug (actually its the same charger that fits many Mot phones) that ripped the guts out of my HS850.I usually fold the Plantronics 510 into a flat configuration before droping it in my shirt pocket when Im not wearing it.  Folded, its slightly bigger than my previous MOT, but its advantage of putting it on my ear with one hand and the isolating abilities of its earpiece outweigh the small size advantage of the HS850.  And the friction fit recharge plug will never rip the guts out of this BT earpiece.I found the on-off button very easy to use, unlike the comments of many others.  I can very easily find the pointy button when the 510 is on my ear. Press for 3-4 seconds and it beeps to tell me its on.  2-3 seconds later a series of tones announces that it has connected with my Motorola i870.  A blue led flashes every 4 or 5 seconds when the unit is on and connected.  Press and hold the pointy power button until the led glows red and it 510 turns off.Its been a great BT headset for me.","4.0","My Second BT Headset","1163376000","11 13, 2006"

"A3BMK3DZDH0N6Q","B0009B0IX4","TechMSS","[15, 15]","I have tried a few different bluetooth headsets, always looking for the Perfect Trifecta of (in order of importance): 1) great audio transmission quality in loud environments, 2) great audio reception (i.e. loud enough, no clicks or pops), and 3) comfort. The Plantronics 510 scores 5 stars for comfort, 5 stars for audio reception, but only 4 stars for audio transmission.To be fair, today's bluetooth headsets will never be as clear as the handset itself, or a wired headset, because bluetooth headsets sample at 8 KHz (i.e. 8,000 audio samples per second), while wired headsets and phones sample at 16 KHz (16,000 audio samples per second). That is why today's bluetooth headsets will always sound just a bit muffled.That said, as far as bluetooth goes, the Plantronics 510 does quite well -- but it has problems. I use it with my BlackBerry 8700. In a quiet environment, such as indoors or in a car with the windows up, audio transmission will be very clear. The boom mic brings the microphone closer to your mouth than do those tiny in-ear headsets, where the microphone is all the way up at your ear. (The microphone is about 3 inches from my mouth, compared to in-ear microphones, which are about 6 inches away.) The closer distance leads to a better, louder sound. However, in a noisy environment, everyone I've talked to finds it somewhat difficult to hear me because the sensitive microphone will pick up a lot of background noise. People have complained that they can hear the beeping of the checkout counter, or all the people chatting at Starbucks, or all the traffic noise, and it's hard to focus on what I'm saying. When I then disconnect the headset and talk directly into the phone, they all say, That's much better! That said, at least people can make out what I'm saying in a loud environment with this headset; with other bluetooth headsets I've used (e.g. the Motorola HS-820), loud environments render my relatively soft voice completely unintelligible.Audio reception is great when you're close to the phone; after about 5-10 feet away, you start to get clicks and pops. (Also, there are a fair number of clicks if I use the headset in my right ear while keeping the BlackBerry in my left pocket; my phone and headset need to be on the same side of my body, it seems, for the clearest sound.) The headset is very loud, and I usually listen to callers at about half-volume.In terms of comfort, Plantronics provides three styles of earbuds: small, medium, and a triangle-shaped larger one. After trying them all, I prefer the medium-sized bud -- I can keep the headset in my ear for over an hour without any discomfort, and sometimes I forget i am wearing it. Admittedly, it took me a while to figure out how to put in on with one hand, but I soon got the hang of it. It now takes me no more than 2 seconds to put it on. (Hint: Hold the earbud/boom-mic section with your thumb and middle finger, and lift the bulky back section up with your forefinger. Place the earbud in your ear, and then remove your forefinger and let the back section naturally fall back behind your ear. It sounds more complicated than it is, but it takes some getting used to.)I used to complain about the small power button, but then I realized that it's extremely easy to press down once the headset is on your ear. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a rocker switch; it presses down, but if you try to power on or off while not wearing the headset, it is tricky to find the right angle at which it needs to be pressed.So, bottom line: This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever used. When I am taking business calls at home and I want to sound as clear as possible, I either talk directly into the headset or use a wired headset with a boom microphone located 1-2 inches from my mouth -- but as far as bluetooth headsets go, the Plantronics 510 is extremely convenient for use when walking about town, or driving. I am giving it four stars because it isn't PERFECT (and I only give five-star ratings for perfection). That said, I will continue to use it as my daily headset until the coming of the Perfect Trifecta of audio transmission, audio reception, and comfort -- which almost certainly will be achieved by Plantronics.","4.0","Great bluetooth headset, with some caveats","1175904000","04 7, 2007"

I kept the Plantronics 510 because it is simply the best I have ever tried. I hear no static, cracks or pops, the audio quality is tops both for me and the caller, and it's comfortable and doesn't flop around on my ear like other headsets do when I move.While the Plantronics may seem slightly larger than other headsets (mainly because it has a larger part that goes behind the ear), it is very comfortable to wear and use, and is very light. It slips into a pocket or bag just as easily as any other Bluetooth headset.The Plantronics 510 comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds to fit your ear perfectly and the speaker goes in (or very close to) your ear, unlike other headsets where the speaker just rests on the outside of your ear which is really not good for getting high volume in windy/noisy environments.  Also the Plantronics has a boom mic that folds down partway towards your mouth. This is way better than headsets where the mic is way up by your ear because the closer the mic is to your mouth, the better you will sound and the less background noise the callers will hear. Everyone I've talked to using this Plantronics have raved at how good I sound, especially compared to the crappy Motorola's I've tried previously.The Voyager 510 has great battery life both while talking and on standby. The Bluetooth range is superb-I can very effectively walk all around my condo from room to room, talking on the phone, yet my cellphone remains on my computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, and through walls too.  And the fact that this headset can even remember pairing with multiple devices is icing on the cake.I really recommend this headset. It's money well spent. Or go ahead and try others, but it would be my educated guess that you will end up with this one eventually, like I did.*There is a slightly misleading bit of text in the instruction manual with regards to charging that you should be aware of: It states that the LED will illuminate Red while charging and illuminate Blue when done charging.

Davis famousdavis","[14, 14]","On the strength of the very high rating and huge reviewer feedback here on Amazon, I bought this Bluetooth device -- my first bluetooth headset ever.  I finally have a phone that has Bluetooth capability, and I was keenly interested in a wireless headset that wouldn't have the cord tangle issues of corded headsets.This device does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It was a piece of cake to setup on my Verizon Samsung u540 phone.  You wouldn't even need to crack open the user manual except to discover the 4-digit code you have to plug-in to your phone (it's 0000, btw).  After that, it's a snap to turn on and link to my phone.My other important concern was voice clarity, both on sending and receiving.  Thus far, after several hours of use, I can tell you that the voice reception I hear is crystal clear.  No crackling, no hollowing or echoing.  On the other end, I've not had anyone complain about being unable to hear my voice or that my voice is coming across muddled -- interestingly, I've had such complaints while using my old, corded headset!The power button *is* small and it *is* a tad more difficult to depress than you might want, but then, you won't accidentally turn on or turn off this device because of the way it's designed.  I agree with others -- turn on the device before putting it on your ear, and do the same when you're turning it off.As for noise canceling, my wife and I tested out this device in very noisy home with four small kids, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this headset communicated my voice but not the ambient noise in the room.Using the volume control on the headset was pretty easy to do.  Note that you can control voice volume either through the phone handset volume control or the control on this Plantronics headset.  If other reviewers are complaining about low volume from this headset, it's likely because one of the two volume controls is turned down too low, or perhaps the mobile phone their using doesn't have much by way of signal output.  This Plantronics headset has *plenty* of loud volume if that's what you want.As for ear comfort, I found it to be very comfortable, although I haven't worn it all day long.  I talked to a friend for an hour yesterday, and I had absolutely no discomfort at all.  The device comes with three earpieces (small, medium and large).  I use the medium with great results.The phone fits snuggly on my ear and it doesn't move around at all, although I'm not jogging or even walking much while using it.I like the more discreet look of having the guts of this device behind my ear, with a thin microphone on the side of my face, rather than the fat Motorola designs.Other reviewers have cautioned about the headset breaking, so I just take very gentle care while handling it.  I suspect I won't have a problem with it falling apart.I can't speak to battery life, because after a lengthy phone call, I just recharge it so it's ready for the next call I might make.  Charging it is easy to do and doesn't take long, either.In sum, I'm very satisfied with this device.  As long as it doesn't break, it's performance and comfortable design make this an excellent choice.","5.0","Works as expected - Easy to use","1177977600","05 1, 2007"

He didn't drop it!  The only thing that he can come up with is that he was sweating because we were having a heat wave in NYC and maybe that messed it up.

Very helpful and took the time to understand my concerns.  We reset and resync'ed and still it sounds horrible.  Our phones are the Sprint Samsung Instincts.  Plantronics said that they do not have them on their list and they are still in the beginning testing phase and that may be the issue.So, I gave it 3 stars for the first hours of use.

The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market, so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers.  (The AC adapter itself is universal voltage, and the slim paper manual is in English.)  The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.  Overall, though, I don't think it's harder to use than a Sony or Nokia.What really impresses me is the build quality of this phone.

"A3KZCNV1N8R9GC","B0009MYS9S","diljs","[44, 44]","These are some decent headphones, but if you use them they WILL break.  It's only a matter of time.  I did some research and found the following tips to prevent/fix the breaking:Solution #1:Put the band portion of the headphones in boiling water for a while and slowly spread them open. Once you have them opened up some take them out of the water and let them cool while holding them in the spread position. This reduces the tension of the headphones against your ears and reduces the stress put on the headphone band. This results in two advantages, less pressure on your ears resulting in better comfort and no cracking of the band.If you stretch them to far they will fit too loose and will lose some of there bass effect. But all you have to do is reheat them and close them up a little until you get the fit you want.Solution #2:Even if your headband has broken in two this will still work. It will only take a little patience and $5.00 of materials from a local hobby shop.Materials:- 3/4 inch or 1 inch nylon tape (all hobby stores that have RC Plane materials have this)- CA (cyanoacrylate) the stuff that superglue is made of but I recommend getting some real CA at any hobbystore. Get the thin stuff.- Saran Wrap. yes the sandwich stuff...- ScissorsSide note: I call the nylon tape tape, but it is really just a ribbon of nylon. There is no sticky stuff on the tape1) First if your headset has snapped completely in two use a little CA to mend it as best as you can. It doesnt need to be perfect but just mended enough that it is technically one piece again and headphones are seperated to where you want them to be.2) Next cut off a 6 inch piece of the nylon tape and using a VERY small amount of CA, tack the top edge of the tape to the BACK of the band where the crack has occured (which should be exactly in the middle of the band in most cases). Use just enough so it sticks as you don't want too much CA getting into the ribbon. It should be hanging down now in the back like a tail. Note: Use the saran wrap to help hold the tape in place as you are tacking it in place as you DO NOT want this stuff to get on your fingers...3) Once the CA has dried enough and the tape is stuck, wrap the tape under and around the band one time until the tape is hanging down again in the back. Pull the tape VERY tight and use a little bit of CA at the top to keep it in place.4) Wrap around one more time and tack it again one more time making sure to always keep the tape tight when you tack it. You should have wrapped the tape around twice at this point. If your set was broken completely in two you may want to wrap one or two more times and at a slight angle to cover a little more area. When done, use some scissors to cut off the excess tape at a point so the cut end of the tape is at the back.5) Now you can saturate the whole band of tape with CA. Use the saran wrap to press down the cut end of the tape as you glue and it will end up perfectly flat. This is an incredibly strong fiberglass patch similar to carbon fiber. The patch will have a very small profile (not that thick) and be similar in color to scotch tape, however it could easily be painted to match the color of the headband if desired.There you have it. This is a permanent and SOLID fix and only takes about 5 minutes. I'm wearing mine right now after i just fixed them. Also you can do this (and I strongly suggest you do) to a set that has not cracked yet, because they WILL NOT CRACK if you do. Just do it exactly in the middle of the band.","4.0","Prevent your headphones from breaking","1157673600","09 8, 2006"
"A12K45UBPC7R7Q","B0009MYS9S","Ed Perkins","[6, 6]","I purchased this unit a few weeks ago from one of Amazon's 3rd party vendors. I got a very good deal, but the trade-off was that it came in a bag with no instructions. I went to the Logitech website and got things going.The pros:1) No wires, and the batteries last about 7 hours (I tried using them all day at work)2) The sound is good enough. (I had been using a Shure e3, which finally broke for good out of warranty). This unit is not near as loud or as bassy as the Shure, but they don't fall off while I'm on the treadmill either.3) Worked well for watching TV in private.The cons:1) Seems to need it's own bluetooth transmitter. My Powerbook bluetooth connected but the sound was so scratchy and bad that it was unusuable. Plug in the supplied transmitter and everything was fine.2) The headband is not adjustable and my ear feels bruised after wearing them for an hour. The time I wore them all day at work won't be repeated.The headband is almost a dealbreaker. If it wasn't for that, I'd be using these headphones all the time.3) The unit is kind of like those watches that use one button for multiple purposes. The button on each part does something different depending on how long you hold down the button. After a couple of days I got the hang of of, but the button on the transmitter is so small, that I have to stop doing anything but holding the button down to turn it off.Overall, I'd say wireless on a treadmill is worth the ear bruising. I can't count how many times I've accidentally hit the cord with my arm and sent my iPod flying across the room. I like to watch videos on it while on the treadmill and the bluetooth headphones make that a pleasant experience instead of constantly trying to watch the cord.

"A2LHL3RYUYLCN8","B0009SA35K","Amazon Customer Marty B","[20, 23]","I must have called Verizon ten times in four months, nagging them to offer the Treo 650 on their network. I almost deserted them to get the phone, but in mid-June, I finally got my Verizon branded Treo 650. It has not been a great experience.First the positives. It is very cool to have all my contacts, all my appointments and todo items on my phone. While the phone is large by today's cell phone standards, it is a great looking unit and functions well. It is easy to set up email and web access and it is great to be able to stay in touch with the normal too-much-email office when I am traveling.However, it is not all great news. First, I have had a heck of a time keeping the unit synchronized with my office Outlook. I get duplicates by the tons and, worse, deleted contacts. The dupes are somewhat tolerable to deal with, but losing contacts, which slip into my deleted Outlook folder is not acceptable. No one has been able to tell my why this is happening.Second, the reception and volume of the phone are horrible. Where my old Motorola TC30 could get calls in awful reception areas, the Treo is spotty inside my own house. I lose calls in transit and while sitting still. Worse, the volume is very faint. I purchased a software tweak called VolumeCare which slightly amplifies the wimpy sound from the phone, but distorts it as well. About the only acceptable solution is to use a headset and plant that sound right in your ear! Not a convenient or very affordable solution.All-in-all, I'm disappointed in the Treo. It has some nice features, but it is very disappointing as a phone.","2.0","Very disappointing phone","1130716800","10 31, 2005"
"AMJ7J9RKQU6EV","B0009SA35K","Chris Morgan Chris Morgan","[13, 13]","I just recieved my Treo 650 four days ago and am happy so far.  I bought it just to be an organizer, phone, mp3 player--in that order--so I can't speak to other features such as web access (currently an expensive $45 from Verizon).Two pieces of advice:1. Budget several hours to set up.  It's nearly like buying a new computer.  I had to transfer my calendar and contacts from my old Cli&eacute; and found that some of my old Palm applications caused the Treo to restart (I promptly deleted them). Generally it was just tedious software stuff, including a tricky firmware update from the Palm website, but don't expect to be ready out the door.2. Before you buy, budget for accessories.  After purchasing the following: case ($20), SD card reader ($10; for the easiest transfer of files to the SD card), 2GB SD card ($150), 2.5MM-compatible headphones ($17), 2.5MM>3.5MM headphone adapter ($10), extra sync cable ($13), mp3 player application ($15; the RealPlayer is clunky and doesn't have a graphic equalizer), I have nearly spent as much as the device itself!  Assuming the Treo gives me years of service, It'll be worth it but I'm going to have to live with the fear that the accessories will not be useful for my next smartphone (I rarely have replaced my cell phones because they got too old, it's normally because they stop working).","4.0","Great so far but set aside time to set up; money for accessories","1122249600","07 25, 2005"
"A1CPRP3VFJRS1R","B0009SA35K","M. Anderson","[42, 45]","The Treo 650 is a great device.  It combines cellular phone, PDA, and wireless functionality, allowing you to check e-mail, surf the web, make phone calls, and keep your contacts and calendar.Be sure to buy an aftermarket USB cable, which will allow you to charge and sync your treo 650 at the same time and a headset adaptor.By downloading a few aftermarket applications (do a search on google), you can make it play internet radio, play MP3's from a 1GB SD card, play some great games, and even use it to access the internet from your laptop while on the road.  Here's what I use:1.  Directory Assistant (by Rick Whitt)-  This program allows you to easily look up and dial busines and residential telephone numbers and get driving directions and maps, without waiting as various web pages load.  I know it sounds like a silly app, and I thought so too, but I now use it all the time to avoid dialing 411 and paying $1.25 per call.  Best of all, its free (but you can and should make a donation).2.  Atom Smash by Red Mercury Software- a great arkanoid style game.3.  BackupBuddy VFS by Blue Nomad - back up the apps on your Treo.4.  Blocks by Electron Hut  - free Tetris Clone5.  ChitChat Lite - a free MSN Messenger client6.  Froggy by Tim Smith - Frogger clone.7.  Galax by Tim Smith - Galaxian clone.8,  PacMan by Horaco Ho - Duh.9.  Pocket Tunes by NormSoft - great MP3 and internet radio player.  Much better control over the audio than the included real player (which only plays MP3s, not internet radio).10.  PDANet by June Fabrics - Allows you to connect your laptop to your Treo and use the internet.  Works great.11.  FileZ by Nosleep software - your basic file manager for the Palm OS.12.  Voice Dial - download - dial calls using the sound of your voice.  Free to say numbers, but must buy to dial by name.13.  Pocket DVD Studio - allows you to compress DVD movies so that they can fit on a SD Card, making your Treo a movie player.","5.0","Make this excellent device even better","1125705600","09 3, 2005"

Is the monitor at home bad because you dropped it off the table. The phone is the best smart phone out there. People have had issues with resets, but that is more of a conflict with the many apps that you can load on it and usually can be solved. I love this phone.

However, I can tell you that it is great for what I need:1.  Great wireless service coverage.  Verizon has the best coverage of any provider.  I even have a signal in elevators and stairwells.2.  Text messaging.  My job requires me to carry a pager.  With this phone, I have forwarded my pager.  Now I only carry one device.  It is great for responding to pages or initiating message dialog.  I have 1,000 messages on my plan, and that should be plenty.  It is very handy to be in meetings and be able to ping people back at their desk for information.3.  Organizer.  I installed the software on my PC at work, and now my Outlook calendar is available wherever I take my phone.  One thing I didn't like was the lack of options on the initial sync.  I wound up with all of my Frequent Contacts from Outlook on my phone - this includes anyone I had ever sent an e-mail to.  Luckily, it is easy to filer on these contacts and delete them.  Be sure to set device overrides desktop on contacts.I don't use the web or e-mail pieces because the data package is too expensive (~$45/mo).  Unless you need to send and receive attachments, SMS is sufficient for e-mail.  Most web queries can be done over SMS to services like Google provides.Overall it's great!","5.0","Great Phone And Organizer","1122422400","07 27, 2005"

It took me a couple days to get used to the feel of the bulkier PDA phone compared to my smaller LG, but once I got into it, I love it.  The only complaints I would have are that it does not come with a docking station (must be purchased separately) and the only way to make it a great phone from a good phone is to add close to $100 worth of various 3rd party software.  While it's a lot of money to bring it up to speed, the flexibility and having options are nice.  Nothing's perfect, but so far, so good (and AllTel has a 30day money back guarantee or exchange deal, so nothing's lost here).","4.0","Great Phone, too much 3rd party needed","1147219200","05 10, 2006"
"ADLVFFE4VBT8","B0009SHMUY","A. Dent Aragorn","[43, 43]","BRIEFLY:This inexpensive wire allows for easy transfer of media files - photos, DRM-free music, videos, etc. between a Sony Ericsson phone and any computer that has a USB port.It is very useful for phone users such as myself who are only interested in a 'phone calls only' plan and are not willing to pay the phone company some extra monthly charge for Internet service.It is needed because the Sony Ericsson phones do NOT support a standard USB interface so a 'normal' USB cable will not work._______________________________________EXTENDED DISCUSSION:I'm not surprised my wife's Sony Ericsson's TM506 came without a USB interface wire. It was a 'free' phone and the phone company wished they could nickel and dime us forever through their 'plans' and and make us pay various monthly service fees for the privilege of downloading a couple of songs or uploading photos or videos we made using the phone's camera. The Sony Ericsson's phones lacking a standard USB interface is probably intimidating enough to persuade most users to succumb to the phone company's demand of an extra $10 or more per month for 'web' access. But it does not need to be this way.Since we only wanted a phone that made phone calls this inexpensive wire allows us to squeeze some extra functionality off our free phone by allowing us to transfer media files in and out of the phone by connecting it to a computer. It's easy, it requires no software installation and we don't need to pay one extra dime to the phone company for the privilege.Positives:- eliminates the need to pay the phone company for an Internet connection- no software installation required- file transfer is actually faster- allows for easy media files transfer to and from OUR computer - all DRM-free files can be easily send to the phone- even users who have an Internet plan may appreciate the ability to connect their phone directly to their computerConcerns:- some minimal computer skills are expected - such as the ability to recognize specific file types and copy or move them to/from specific foldersConclusion: recommended to any Sony Ericsson phone user, with or without a media or Internet plan.","5.0","The wire 'they' wish you didn't have","1247702400","07 16, 2009"

It was a Christmas present for someone that had relied on a car charger for years. She'd plug it into her car outlet and let it sit in her car until it was charged. I assumed I just solved her problem. Unfortunately, her Motorola Razr is such a dinosaur, I'd have to special order it from the actual manufacturer.Here's the surprise part......I just moved and finally found my Kindle. It's the Kindle touch, nothing special (not the fire or paperwhite). It's simply a black and white touch screen. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the charger, no matter where I looked! Even so, the charger that came with the Kindle would take about 2-3 hours to fully charge, when it's nearly dead. So,I decided to try this on my Kindle to see if it would fit.

I made a call right after I bought it and the person on the other end could not tell I was using a hands free device.Like all Jabra hands-free ear gizmos, this one comes with a variety of gel-like ear inserts for different shaped ears and for those who want to use the gizmo on their left ears instead of the right.My less than perfect rating is the less-than flexible adjustment for the piece that goes around the ear. It's a snug fit, to be sure, but a little too snug. After a recent lengthy phone call, my ear was so fatigued from being squeezed for so long, it gave me a headache. There is no way to take the snug tension down a notch.

Oh, it will call and we'll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of hello-hello? HELLO? Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected.When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down.More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often, that can cause a problem.Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good.On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.Even though I can't take this headset back, I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone. The BT350 simply doesn't meet any of those standards.","2.0","They should call it buck-tooth","1138579200","01 30, 2006"

On the other hand, I've heard that all bluetooth devices with same standard (i.e. version 1.2) should have no compatibility problem. It turned out to be absolutely smooth when connecting to my Samsung. The headset can flash and even vibrate when call's coming.The headset is amazingly light weight. You can't even imagine a lithium battery is sitting in such a leather-weight body that can hold on for 7 hours' talking.I spent $10 on this headset and couldn't be more happy.","5.0","Easy, light, and inexpensive","1176249600","04 11, 2007"
"A1N5FSCYN4796F","B0009W8DL2","Philip R. Heath Gadgets, Music, & Books","[13, 13]","Your first question is what other headsets am I comparing this to. See my reviews of the Motorola HS850, Jabra BT250v, Plantronics 320 Explorer for reference. Now let's consider this headset in terms of the four key performance categories: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - I was able to pair this headset with my LG VX-9800 on the first try. The instructions in the manual are straightforward so I will not repeat them hear. The experience is similar to what I had with the BT250v.Sound Quality - This is really the top area to question with a headset. I'm happy to report that this headset delivers nicely in this area. I am able to use less than the max volume setting in most cases which is definite progress over the other headsets I have used. On the other end, it is important that you don't have the volume louder than you need it because otherwise people hear an echo of themselves due to the close proximity of the speaker to the microphone. However, I have found the echo to be less of an issue than it is on the HS850.Ease of Use - The key to a Jabra headset is holding the multifunction button down until it flashes. This turns the headset on and off after pairing. You will hear reports of people winding up redialing the last number called when trying to turn the headset off. If you don't wait for the flash, this will happen. I've also heard this reported during pairing, but that shouldn't be the case because you start pairing with the headset turned off. Finally, the volume buttons are easy to use. I only use the headset on my right ear so I can't speak to what it is like when the headset is flipped over and the buttons are on top.Comfort - I also found this headset to be the clear winner in the area over the other three that I have used. I wear glasses so the over the ear hook is a necessity. I think that they have also hit the sweet spot on placement of the speaker. The speaker is raised from the surface of the headset as opposed to the HS850 which is flush with the main body of the headset. However, it does not go into your ear like the BT250v or the Plantronics 320. I guess another way to put it is it rests just outside of the ear canal so the speaker is as close to being inside your ear without actually being so. I think that this maximizes comfort and contributes to the better sound quality. Finally, the vibrate feature is very disturbing if you are not used to it. Don't let that stop you though because it is something that you can turn off if you so desire.","5.0","Best Bluetooth Headset I've Ever Used!!","1155859200","08 18, 2006"

It took a while to set up (problems with resetting my phone), but once I synced the two devices, I have not had any problems.  The sound quality is superb, and the functions are outstanding.  They include vibrating alert (I've turned it off), call accept and call decline (much needed).  It also allows you the opportunity to automatically call the last number dialed. The voice dialing also works great.  I was not able to record the name through the BT350, but once recorded, the phone recognized the name when spoken through the BT350.

It dropped audio connections while dialing, or after 20 minutes of conversation. (Replacement unit has also exhibited this, but less.) Contacted Jabra about the charging issue, they required that I a) return the headset under an RMA, and THEN they will b) send me a new one. After less than a month of use. I found another way to get a replacement (boomerang purchase at a local chain 'tronics store.)On the plus side, it lasts on standby for a few days (vice a few hours like my Sony BT headset does). It fits around my ear, and comfortably in my ear, very easily. The loop is soft rubber, so no sharp or rigid plastic is clamping on your outer ear. If the sound is not quite loud enough (the volume controls are easy to find by touch, but this in-ear speaker can only blast so much), the earbud can be gently pressed in to form a seal, and is easier to hear this way. Sound is so-so, some callers have told me they can't hear me if there's ambient sound, music, wind, or cars nearby. In all, better than average, but this is the second Jabra product that's crapped out on me, so be wary. (I recommend always owning a wired headset as a backup, and particularly for business or important personal use.)** JULY 2008 UPDATE **I've now used this for 2 years and can give it a much better review. The unit has held up well (though the tip broke and had to be glued back). It still holds several hours charge, where my old Sony headset now lasts one 10 minute conversation and dies. The shape, weight, and ergonomic fit are so unobtrusive that I've had some companions remind me I'm still wearing it after hanging up on a call. Although I didn't like the shiny bling microphone tip, I've now softened on this design. The BT500 is still more attractive and less attention getting than others. Because I have a headset at work, and my new car has a HandsFreeLink feature, I use this unit at home, and after two years, it still works great. I recommend this headset without reservation.

(I also liked the Samsung WEP200 but it's a different style so I won't compare it here) I work in a noisy construction environment and drive a noisy construction van so background noise is a huge issue. Plus I need the headset to stay put even when I'm lying on the ground, sideways, etc. This over and behind the ear style works well for me. I tested all 8 headsets by pairing two at a time and putting one in each ear, then switching between them while on the same call. This let me and the caller compare the sound quality equally from both sides of the call. In a nutshell, the Jabra BT500 wins on function and the Plantronics 510 wins on sound quality. Given that background noise is such a big issue for me, I have to go with the 510. The BT500 has better designed buttons that both feel and work better. But, the sound problems are: 1) The BT500 always sounds slightly more muffled, even in a quiet environment 2) The BT500 has the mic so close to your face that it often touches and makes noise, especially when trying to use a button and 3) in a noisy environment the Plantronics 510 wins hands down. With the kind of background noise I get, I couldn't use the Jabra BT500. I have to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510 and all the other issues have to take a back seat to the sound. For those that would use this in a quiet environment I can say that the sound quality is only slightly worse than the 510 and may not outweigh the better function of the BT500.","4.0","Jabra BT500 vs. Plantronics Voyager 510","1205020800","03 9, 2008"

This is a great phone with a pretty intuitive interface (though, that doesn't go for the Verizon version from what I've seen). The one downside is that call volume could stand to be louder, especially if one is in a crowded area. A bluetooth headset effectively eliminates this problem.Speaking of bluetooth, I was supremely impressed by how open Cingular left the bluetooth options (again, the Verizon interface differs in this respect). You're able to transfer any wallpaper, ringtones, and videos on and off with ease.The only hurdle is pairing the phone for the first time. The trick is to initiate pairing on the PC while the bluetooth connection is active. For example, send a file from the phone to your PC (using the copy function while a file is selected) and quickly initiate pairing from your PC. You only have to go through this once, after that everything is a breeze. Hope that helps anyone who was as stuck as I was.

It explains that sometimes cell phone approval is slow and included the following:Until this is resolved, it is possible that the information in theYour Account section of the Amazon site will incorrectly indicate thatthis order requires your attention and may direct you to cancel - pleasedisregard this until we get more information.WHAT???!!!They tell me to cancel the order, knowing that this is incorrect???Well, I followed their screwy directions, and they lost an order and alot of goodwill on my part.Amazon has been successful, they must know what they are doing, but this kind of behavior makes you wonder...To new cell buyers, BEWARE the incorrect message.","3.0","BEWARE the incorrect message","1128902400","10 10, 2005"
"AVK9BSXJJ51I8","B000A1329U","S. Allen","[0, 0]","Oct 7th 2005If you look carefully at these so called bad reviews you will notice most of them either don't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a shared plan from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your Cell phone Numbers right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a single 700 rollover mins shared plan before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to My Account from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular in my area puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away With NO ROAMING charges btw our last cell phone service Alltel would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in Speaker Phone mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call Mobile to Mobile.We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it needs charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the address book being slow not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you dont, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by Name or Speed dial # or Voice name or even by Email and with or without a picture of the person.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for list only no picture and by primary number only, simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in Categories such as Business/Personal/General/VIPsBring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have primary number only listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about ear piece volume too low I'm in total agreement with Harry G from TN the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the volume is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, but like Harry mentioned make sure your ear is right at the top edge of the phone, too low and volume will sound low.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose PHONE seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under sunlight is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.(Update 4/30/06.)Well 7 months later and these phones are still working flawless with ZERO problems of anykind.I charge it maybe twice a week so battery life is still great.Neither my wife or I have this alleged sound problem some seem to have the earpiece and speakerphone volume are plenty loud.My wife is constantly playing solitaire on hers, so she has worked the hell out of that keypad the last 7 months and no problems.These phones are the best we have ever had by far, so like I said before take these bad reviews with a grain of salt.Some may indeed have a faulty unit which is going to happen regardless which phone you buy, but I bet a large percentage of these problems are simply operator error.These phones are excellent and I would recommend them to anyone.Still the only slight fault that I can gripe about on them is the screen is hard to see in bright sunlight.and it took an extra couple weeks to get rebate but was no problem, just a single phone call and problem was solved.(Update June 23th 2006)Have had these phones over 9 months so far without a single problem, they work flawless.As I said above anyone giving this phone a bad rating either has that rare bad one of the bunch or simply doesn't know how to use the phone. I have dropped this phone 3X so far, last time was 4 days ago in the parking lot on concrete and no problems at all, not even a scratch. (Of course the Krussel case is outstanding and helps a lot)We used both our phones while on a Cruise to the Caribbean and as long as we were in an area/Island that had cell service we had good reception and no problems at all, and as long as we were in a US territory (Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John) the calls were not roaming.You get the phones for FREE, Amazon is good to order from with no problems, Cingular so far for us anyway have been very good and the service (in our area) is far better than what Alltel was.There may be some phones out there as good, some im sure will have a better camera, however I seriously doubt you will find a better all around cell phone & service.","5.0","Look carefully at bad reviews","1128643200","10 7, 2005"

The only nice feature is the camera and there are a lot of other cell phones with better features that have cameras too.  Also beware of the so-called rebate.  If you don't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it, well go for it but if your time is money, run from this rebate and this phone.  5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool, hip cell phone.  How wrong we all were.  Cingular is fine.  They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us.  3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates.  The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops.  One mistake and you are screwed out of the $150 rebate.Another problem with the phone and it's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look.  All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.I have never written a review before on Amazon or otherwise, but I feel that people should be aware that the cool, hip advertising of the RAZR is not what it is cracked up to be.","2.0","Not what it's cracked up to be","1140220800","02 18, 2006"

The fit is perfect, all cut-ous line up with the phone ports, speakers, etc.  This phone actually fits the Razr slightly better than the Body Glove I use for my Motorola V551.It provides some protection from drops, the elements, etc. both externally and internally, whereas many cases, including the popular hard cases for Razrs protect only the exterior.A few people have written reviews that the phone doesn't close a swell as it does without the case.  It closes fine.  You add a slight thickness to the edge of the phone with a case on it, so basically it closes all the way, almost exactly the same as without a case, but because of the case, you won't hear the phone cover click shut but it is closed and its not like the front is suddenly lose or pops open.

All in all, for having it over four years, it's a great purchase.  Although I'm still using mine daily, I'm ready to purchase a new one, and one with a battery is the best, as I simply carry AAA batteries in my car, so whenever this one dies, I just put a new one in on the go.  No worrying about bringing it into the house to charge, forgetting to take it back out, or losing the charging cord.

"A1VCXIWWOWYZ94","B000BBAKWQ","O. C.","[0, 0]","Comfort: My main problem with this headset was that it is not very comfortable on my ear.  When I first got it, I couldn't wear it for more than 5-10 minutes.  Now that my ear has become accustomed to it, I can wear it for an hour or so.  It just takes getting used to.  However, I wish I could rotate the headset without rotating the earhook like some bluetooth headsets.  In order to have the headset have a tight grip on my ear (and not fall off), I have to rotate the headset so that it points upwards towards my eyebrows instead of downwards towards my mouth.  It's not really an inconvenience per se, but it looks pretty uncool.  Perhaps I have misshapen ears.Audio: The sound is fantastic.  Only sometimes does it get staticky in my pocket, and not often enough to notice, at least on my end.Ease-of-Use:  This headset was easy to pair with my Motorola KRZR and the main things I do (hanging up, answering calls, and adjusting volume) are simple and intuitive.  Only problem is that if you don't hold buttons for the correct length of time, it can perform the wrong function.  For example, pressing the call button once activates voice dialing, for 1 second redials your last call and 3 seconds turns it off.  I've done my share of accidentally redialing.Battery: I was disappointed when I learned the battery wasn't rechargeable and it instead uses a AAA battery, but the lifetime is very long.  It's supposedly 30 hours or so.  I can't verify that, I just know I've been using it for two months now without replacing it, and it's just a regular Energizer battery.Durability: I carry this around in my jacket pocket most of the time and it holds up well.  I do find myself accidentally turning it on when I lean against something, but I just need to be more careful.","4.0","Good Enough","1201219200","01 25, 2008"
"A3D1F28RDA23QA","B000BBAKWQ","Tall Paul","[23, 23]","The Motorola H300 is the ultimate handsfree headset for those that want a headset that they will be able to use forever.  Why do I say this?  Because, this does not have a non-removable rechargeable battery like most handsfree headsets.  Instead, it can be operated with a single AAA battery.  I just got it, so I cannot verify the performance of the battery, but knowing that I won't have to throw this away in a couple of years is worth it.  The features include call accept, call deny, mute, hold, voice dialing, 3 way calling, and you can turn off the blinking blue light (if you're so inclined).  Even though it takes a AAA battery, it's about the same size as a comparable rechargeable headset.  It may be 2 mm thicker, but the same length as most.  It works great and is a no nonsense kind of headset.  If you want a basic headset that does about the same as those expensive ones, and you want the security of just changing a battery, this is the headset for you.  If I have any problems with the duration of the battery or with its operation, I will update this review accordingly (check the date of review to gauge how long since purchase... if no update, then no problem).","5.0","Awesome for the Price","1167782400","01 3, 2007"

"A2LHL3RYUYLCN8","B000BBCTJ8","Amazon Customer Marty B","[97, 98]","My last Bluetooth headset, a Cardo Scala 500 featured great sound, wonderful battery life but a poor, floppy fit and very crummy construction. The poor thing literally fell apart after three months.I replaced the Cardo today with a Plantronics Explorer 320 and I'm pretty satisfied. First, recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users. It's pretty important that you buy from a source, like Amazon, where you can try things and return them if not satisfied. EBay may have great prices on stuff, but unless you know you'll like something, I wouldn't suggest buying a BT Headset there... way too hard to return.The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets, but it is hard to see where they scrimped. The fit and finish of the product is excellent. The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly. It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name.Using the 320, I made several calls to automated numbers. All connected quickly, except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords. In that call, there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone. My old Cardo had the same delay, so I think this is a function of the phone.The fit of the headset is great for me. The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear, and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort. I've been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable. Your mileage may vary.So what's not perfect? The sound quality isn't quite there. I pick up some static between the device and my Treo and it gets worse when the phone is on the other side of my body or when I move more than five feet away. It's not horrible, but it's there in my setup. Again, your mileage may vary.","4.0","Great moderately priced BT headset","1130630400","10 30, 2005"

"A1N5FSCYN4796F","B000BBCTJ8","Philip R. Heath Gadgets, Music, & Books","[25, 32]","I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others.  Well, it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for.  Let's consider the following in why I am returning this headset: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use, but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts, I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However, it shouldn't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.Sound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion.  With the speaker resting inside my ear, I didn't have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called.  My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception.  When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 (out of 4), she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel.  Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem, but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset, but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar Please say a command from my phone.  However, what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions, but I kept getting Please say a command.  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing, voice commands, and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work, but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply, this headset isn't for you.Comfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost; however, I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time.  The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear.  It is not removable, and try as I might to adjust it, I could not find a comfortable position.  The ear hook is also fairly rigid.  These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.I have to consider this headset to be a failure.  On the box, it touts Comfort and Ease of Use.  As you can see from my results, it doesn't deliver on either of these.  It's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price.  Unless you have the ear it was modeled after, though, I would not buy it.","2.0","Doesn't Deliver On Its Potential","1143590400","03 29, 2006"

I liked the single button function and found it worked great with only a rare glitch when the headset would partially connect to the phone resulting in me being able to hear through the headset but needing to speak through the phone. (Turn off the headset and turn it back on. No need to end the call.) My partner and I both used one of these hard core for over a year in a construction environment until I broke the ear loop on mine and moved on to the 510. Considering what we put them through, I have to say that this unit holds up. I compare headsets by pairing two of them, putting one in each ear and switching between them while on the same call.

Its not unbearable, but more like annoying.  Secondly, they are a little big, but for what they do, its understandable.  WARNING: These headphones will make you look like a tech dork.  But who cares?  They're freaking wireless.Now, with that out of the way, its time for the good parts.  The sound quality is good.  The battery life is long and wonderful(10 to 16 hours).  Charge time is short.  Charging is convenient using the same usb charger as my razr cell phone.  Only need to bring one charger on trips.  The quality is good.  This headphones seem to be constructed well.  Set up is generally easy.  The directions suck, but the only vital info I found to be missing is that pairing can take up to a minute or so.  The vocal quality is good enough.  My callers can hear me well enough, but they are  aware that I am using some sort of hands free device.Overall, I am very happy with these headphones.  I would recommend these to anyone (as long as you don't mind looking like tech dork).","4.0","Wires?  What for?","1171670400","02 17, 2007"

"ASO5UIVULSB3Q","B000BBE9C8","Ronald Ih rimb1172","[11, 12]","I got the HT820 a few days ago and for the most part I am very happy with it. Contrary to what some people have said, it *does* simultaneously connect with a phone and PC. I am using a Treo 700p PDA phone and a Lenovo X60 Thinkpad with integrated Bluetooth. If it doesn't do that for you, it is most likely a driver/SW problem with your phone and/or PC. It takes two to tango and people are all too ready to blame the headset when it is just as likely to be a problem with their source.When I'm listening to music I have stored on my X60 it plays the music well and the controls all work with Windows Media Player. If I get a call, the music will pause and I can take the call on my Treo. When I end the call, the music resumes. The sound quality is decent. It's not audiophile quality, but if you want that from a $70 wireless headset, your head is screwed on wrong. It's certainly good enough for what I want it for which is casual listening while I'm working.One big plus is that the HT820 stays connected to my Treo 700p much better than my Plantronics Discovery 640. With the 640, the headset always drops the BT connection about 1 minute after ending a call. The 640 does this with my Treo 100% of the time. I am reasonably sure it is a problem with the Treo's BT so it is technically not the fault of the 640, but the HT820 appears to handle the Treo BT problem much better.A few issues I have:1) My biggest problem is that the rubber that goes over the ears has a bit of a harder edge than I would like and after a little while it gets somewhat uncomfortable. I'm going to try a little moleskin from the local Walgreen's to see if that helps.2) The sound quality of the microphone is just so-so. My friends that hear me on the other end of my calls say it sounds somewhat muffled compared to my Plantronics 640. They can still clearly hear me and understand what I'm saying, but in a relative comparison the 640 has a better sound detection circuit.Finally, I do get occasional dropouts on my music, but I know it is the BT software on my Treo again. I can see that when the Treo drops the BT connection, the HT820 tries repeatedly to reconnect and the music from my PC gets spotty until it connects and then it's fine again. The other times I get dropouts is when the X60 is doing something fairly processor intensive. I guess audio is considered low priority in the software and is one of the first things to get put on hold.As others have mentioned, there is a noticable lag in the audio when you are watching video or playing games. This is expected because of the extra encoding/decoding step that has to happen when you send it digitally over BT and then the headset has to decode it again. I would say BT headsets in general are best for listening to pure audio since there is nothing visual to be in sync with. They are OK for video if you can deal with the slight delay in the sound. It kinda looks like those old kung fu movies where peoples' mouths will move slightly ahead of when you hear what they are saying. Any BT headset is going to have this issue until they come out with software and system design changes that compensate for it.I have tried it with some games and they are OK for turn-based games like Galactic Civilizations where the audio is not crucial to the game action. However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up. Gotta stick to low-tech analog headsets for that.Overall, it is very good but not perfect. If it weren't for the over-the-ear comfort issue, I would give it a 5.","4.0","Almost perfect","1185235200","07 24, 2007"

I use it with Motorola L2 cell phone and Anycom 250 USB dongle for Skype.  This is the one to get.

"A1EA5OZDASEEMY","B000BD3210","Andytech","[1, 1]","I got this headset last week Wednesday and have been using it ever since.  I read a lot of reviews and found as much information as I could about this before even ordering it.  And after reading very mixed reviews, I just had to find out for myself.So here it is:I use it with my Motorola Q, which is also not a bad phone, and it works perfectly fine with it.  It paired up without any problems and stays connected when you want it to stay connected.  I have not had the opportunity to really test out the battery life yet, but I have tested it for approx 2 hours in between charges and it holds up fine for 2 hours.Incoming sound quality is perfect.  Actually a little too loud, but you can just lower the volume.Outgoing sound is also much better according my girlfriend who has heard me on my previous Sony HBH-660, and she says that the sound quality is much better.  Even when I have my windows rolled down going 65, she says she can hear me fine, although she says it sounds like I have the faucet running.  So I do question how the DSP itself works since it doesn't really filter out the windnoise.The system itself is pretty sleek and gives you multiple charging options.  So there should be no worry of running out of battery unless you talk consistently for more than 3 hours at a time.One gripe I do have is the button and the plastic.  The button should be easier to press and should require as much pressure as it does.  The plastic seems kind of cheap, which is probably what makes the thing so light, you barely even notice you have it on. So they should have use better plastic with better chrome paint that doesn't scratch or chip off.Overall, I give it 2 thumbs up and the best headset I have used so far.","5.0","Great headset in a not so great package.","1152489600","07 10, 2006"

Koehncke","[12, 12]","At airports watching people talking into space with some huge clam attached to their ear with a flashing blue light swore me off bluetooth. This headset from Plantronics is extremely small, nicely packaged, it paired immediately with my Blackberry 7100t.The packaging is very cleverly done and the headset itself is a simple silver cylinder and weights a mere 9 grams. Audio quality was high and a recent 7100t software upgrade increased volume levels to more than acceptable. A variety of included ear pieces ensure you're likely to find a comfortable fit. I've been getting about 2-3 hours of talk time on a single charge which while not perfect is adequate for most people.As a small minus, the button to connect/disconnect/turn-on or off takes a bit of getting used to as it feels a bit mushy missing a positive click to confirm your selection.If you're worried about compatibility, the Plantronics website provides a pull down selector for mfg/phone to confirm.","5.0","Small, good audio quality","1132617600","11 22, 2005"

My first was a Motorola with deficiencies in volume, talk time, not to mention how awkward it was to store when not in use.Plantronics has taken care of all of these areas.  This unit is plenty loud, even when traveling in a noisy vehicle at highway speeds.  The pen type slip case that goes in a pocket or clips on a shirt at the neck line is a good Idea.  By using rechargeable batteries (slides into the pen-style carrier) you don't even need to purchase a car charger or home charger.  I've purchased a small portable charger that goes into the computer bag I travel with.  Every morning, I replace the battery and the head set stays charged all day long.  When I say all day long, I mean it.  I'm on the phone over 3,000 minutes every month ... occasionally as much as 5,000 minutes. I love the Mute feature too; most BT head sets don't have this.The ear insert is the only thing I worry about down the road.  It is always exposed and vulnerable.  Not to mention the fact that it will probably discolor as it ages.  This is the only reason I don't give it five stars.  But, in fairness, if having the insert is the reason for the great volume ... I wouldn't have it any other way.I have been using this product for over a month now and I recommend it highly.Plantronics, one recommendation for you; make the battery rechargeable so I don't have to change it out every morning.

At the above price, it's a bit expensive, but an excellent value. It should have come with a USB charger adapter included; instead, this is supposedly available as an add-on accessory, yet can't be found for sale anywhere. My report card:Design: A-, very simple and lightweight design. Buttons are few and usable, after some practice. Comes with 4 different adapters for OEM phone chargers, which is a novel yet cumbersome approach. Includes additional accessories for a more custom fit. Carrying pocket doubles as charging station; headset fits dangerously loosely inside, and the pocket itself doesn't clip securely onto shirt pockets or belts. An aluminum carrying case is provided to keep everything together.Aesthetics: A-, it's a tiny and stylish piece.Build quality: B+, the materials look more solid than they are. Construction is fair.Comfort: A+, the most comfortable and stable headset ever. Multiple ear gels aid in attaining a custom fit that is quite secure. An earhook is also provided for added stability, but probably won't be needed.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing or using this headset. Full handsfree functionality is available, but controls differ greatly for different functions and take some learning.Outbound sound quality: B+, callers can hear me great, along with any other noises in the environment. Lack of noise cancellation makes this headset worthless in, for example, a crowded room. No echo whatsoever, though.Inbound sound quality: B, volume is beyond plentiful. Inbound voices are rich in bass but *completely* lack crispness. Frequent static regardless of range or line-of-sight.","3.0","Great unit EXCEPT for the sound quality!","1137369600","01 16, 2006"
"A1OZA52DFY3SHD","B000BD3210","Gaz Rendar","[8, 8]","I purchased this headset from Amazon for about $80 and have had it for over a month.  I pair it with my RAZR and Uniden's cordless ELBT595.  I've been highly pleased with it's performance.BLUETOOTH PAIRINGThis was extremely easy and handled through the one master button at the top.  Hold it down until it flashes red and it will pair with your phone.  Answer calls by pushing the button, and hang up by pushing the button.  Simple as that.  I've gotten consistent call quality within a range of 10 feet from the phone, and haven't experienced any interference from WiFi networks.VOLUMEI think the biggest problem with bluetooth headsets is that they are not loud enough.  I tried several different bluetooth headsets that my friends have, most noteably the Motorola HS850 and H700.  Those work well but I still have a hard time hearing people when I'm driving in a car, or there is a low level of ambient noise in the background.  The greatest feature of the Plantronics 640 is that it fits in your ear, and is therefore probably twice as loud as any other headset I've tried.  I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.  You can also mute the headset by pushing the up and down volume buttons simultaneously.COMFORT/FITI was skeptical about the fit of this headset.  I never liked earbud headphones (think iPod) as they fail to stay in my ears whenever I have to move around.  That's why I was astonished that the Plantronics 640 stays in my ear without any problems.  And it is very comfortable as I've worn it for periods over 1 hour and have not had any irritation.  Since it fits in your ear, and not over it, you can easily wear sunglasses with it (great for driving).  If I know I'm going to be highly active while wearing the headset, I will put the optional over-the-ear clip on it, but for most instances it is not necessary.DESIGNThe 640 is small and light, and stylish enough for me.  The headset comes with a bevy of attachments and a carrying case.  The headset fits into a pen-clip holder that serves two purposes.  First, you can carry your 640 in your shirt pocket if you wish (and look extremely nerdy I might add).  But the pen clip adapter is the common link to charge the headset.  Put the headset into the pen clip and you can now charge it with the included AC adapter, or you can add one of the extra attachments to the pen clip so that you can use your phone's charger to also charge the 640.  Almost all phone types are supported.  There is also a AAA battery adapter that can link up to the pen clip and be used to charge your 640.  The battery life of the headset itself is great; I've talked on it for about 5 hours and the headset still didn't die.PROBLEMSThere are few and they're nit-picky ones.  It's unfortunate that the adapter to use the RAZR's mini-USB phone charger to charge the 640 is not included.  You can buy one off eBay for under $20, though.  The pen clip adapter is ok, but not the absolute best way to carry your 640 around.  It fits in any pocket, and protects the mic, but does not cover the earbud side of the headset.  Therefore, I usually carry the 640 in the small case it comes with.  But this case holds ALL the attachments and it would be nice if there was something smaller to transport the headset alone that protected the entire headset and was smaller than the full case.  Some people have also complained that the mic picks up lots of ambient noise.  I find this to be the case of all headsets, bluetooth or corded.  If you're in a crowd, people are not going to be able to hear you on your cell phone or bluetooth headset--they are going to hear the crowd.  I believe there is a new 645 model that has some noise-cancellation features, but that is done with digital software processing, not filters physically sitting on the mic.OVERALLI don't think the perfect bluetooth headset has been produced yet.  But I'm giving this one 5 stars because as of June 2006 this one is reliable and is undoubtably the loudest headset out there.  My hearing is just fine, but if the volume on your headset or cell phone is the biggest sticking point with you, then this is probably the best headset you can get.  If you can get this headset for $80 or less, I highly recommend it.","5.0","The best bluetooth headset I've tried","1149638400","06 7, 2006"

I just paired the two devices and added it on in handsfree mode. This headset is light and extremely comfortable in my ear. Just move the gel earpiece to the left if you use it in your right ear for additional comfort. Conversely, move the gel earpiece to the right if you use it in your left ear. It fits so well in my ear that I don't have any need to use the ear loop.The sound clarity is great. Everyone I talk to says they hear me very well. I just needed to raise the volume up a little to hear everyone perfectly. I don't hear any static whatsoever when I use this headset in my wifi and bluetooth networks at home.Plantronics gives you a lot of charging options. I use the SE charging adapter, which I snapped on at the bottom of the little pocket case, so I could use one charger for two gadgets. This headset comes with a Nokia, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericcson adapter for charging. The headset also comes with its own charger, in case you don't own one of these 4 phone models, which you can use in any wall outlet. I tried that method of charging and it works fine too.This headset also comes with a mobile charger case, where you use a AAA battery. I didn't try that method of charging since I have a SE car charger which works well with the included SE adapter.Voice dialing works fine. That's important to me since I'm a mobile professional who spends a lot of time traveling in my car.The headset does beep right before you make a call. It also beeps right before it signals for the name you want to call. I don't find that irritating, as one other reviewer mentioned. That's just how the headset operates.

They even give you a mirror on the back of the case (I guess so you can see how cool you look with the headset).  Out of the box, it's easy to setup.  Took about 1.5 hrs to charge the headset.Pros:  This headset is light, small, and well designed.  The ear gel isn't intrusive like the old Jabras.  I would say it's like an earphone that you would use for mp3s, except it's made out of rubber which is good so it won't slip out.  they give you 2 other gels if the default doesn't fit.  I have a small set of ears, and the default is perfect.  It pairs easily with my LG PM 325 (Sprint Phone).  I don't notice a difference between this and my old Logitech in terms of sound quality, meaning the quality is excellent.  They heard me, I heard them, it was clear, no static.  If you DO get static it's just the downfall of BT technology (wi-fi, walls, or microwave interference).  It also comes with 4 different charging attachments for Motorola, Nokia, Siemens, and Sony Eriksson.  You can also use the power adapter they supply which works well.  I like the pen/marker sized charger you can put it in, and though I can't see myself using the AAA battery option to charge, it's great to be able to charge it anywhere if need be.Cons:  Well, here it is:  I wish there was a wind guard.  This would be a great feature to have since it's so mobile, and wouldn't it be better if we could use it outdoors?  Foam isn't that expensive to add...  Secondly, there should have been noise reduction feature.  Trust me, it pick up everything; dishes in the back, people talking, stereo, blah blah.  Oh well.  Otherwise it's great. .  Other than that, the price is the biggest con.  I got it here when J&R; had it for $69.  But $89?!  Ridiculous.  Even $70 is high for a BT headset these days.  But hey, you pay for the look, feel, and fit.If you don't care about obtrusiveness, get the Logitech Mobile Freedom.  It's cheaper.  One thing that was different is that the Logitech after finishing a call, sometimes it would disconnect from my phone (the BT connection I mean) which was annoying if I wanted to make another call right away.

After charging it up and attempting sync with my Motorola v360, I found I couldn't get it to work. I re-read the manuals for the 640 and for my v360 to see if it was me. Then I went on the web to see if I had some compatibility issue. It then occurred to me that I might have actually gotten a bad piece of electronics - which is a pretty rare occurrence nowadays. I was able to cross check the Discovery and my phone with a friend's bluetooth headset (Moto HS820 and v600) and found that the Plantronics was the culprit.Bottom line: check before you get too far from the store. Since it is usually a hassle to return items via mail order, i would only buy from a brick and mortar store.Here is a tidbit you might want to know about bluetooth chips (ICs) - they are not always fully tested! I am directly involved in the semiconductor testing industry and have been for many years. Bluetooth chips, and many other relatively low cost consumer semiconductor devices, are NOT fully tested. Instead, the lots of devices are sample tested to statistically insure that a very high percentage are good. This is in direct contrast to higher value chips, such as Intel, AMD and PPC microprocessors, that are much more fully tested at multiple steps. The low cost nature of bluetooth chips (as well as many mp3, 802.11, etc.) really mandates the sampled test approach. For the most part, we get away with it. In the case of the unit I bought, it was not sufficient. The fact that I got a defective finished headset means that it is unlikely that Plantronics does 100% testing of its finished headset in addition to the known fact that the IC manufacturer they use is unlikely to do 100% testing. Once again, check it before you leave the parking lot.I will try one of these again as soon as they are back in stock and report on it again if I get a functional unit.","3.0","Check before leaving store","1132358400","11 19, 2005"

But it does work well, and it's so small and lightweight you barely notice it's there.  The 3 earbuds give you a pretty good range of sizing, in my opinion, but the ear-clip thing is not that great.  It's much better just balanced in your ear with the right size earbud.No, you can't use it outside on a windy day, but you can't use ANY headset like that, well, maybe some of the higher end noise cancelling units, but not something this small.  The reviews that knock that fact are not being fair.  It works great for what it's designed for, and if you need to use it in bad conditions, get a noise cancelling headset, or you will never be happy.Paired up with my Treo 650 with no problems, and actually works better than the Jabra with my Treo.  The Jabra would want to be 'reset' before every call, or it would default to the built in mic, but the Plantonics just works once it's turned on.  And when you get a call while wearing it, just hit the easy to find button to answer and again to hang up.  Works fine.","4.0","I like it","1142208000","03 13, 2006"

I haven't tried the auxiliary truck plug on this one as I don't want to fry the battery. The AC power brick has a rated output of 9V so I suspect the 5V difference is what does in the battery. This one I have only used the AC adapter & the battery life is at best abysmal. The info supplied claims a standby life of up to 100 hours & talk time of up to 6 hours. Not even close. Yesterday my unit ran 6 hours standby & 1 hour talk before it had to be recharged. If this unit lived up to it hype I would give it 5 stars, but with its poor battery life I only give it 2.

I've never been happy with its performance-it was small and light, but at freeway speeds I just could not hear the other party.I purchased this headset four days ago. I could not be happier. This morning I sat it on my head for a long commute, and forgot it was there within 5 minutes. The road was wet, but even with the accentuated tire noise I could hear every word. I made several calls, and one person was not aware I was in my car.I have a slight audio discrimination problem, which makes it hard for me to hear over noise. This headset has a leatherette ear cushion that fits over the ear, blocking most noise. It can also be turned quite loud, uncomfortably so. This is great, because you are never wanting for volume.It comes with both wall charger and car charger, so I'll never have to carry this one in to the house to charge it.Look at the photos before buying: notice that this is a big headset. That's part of what makes it work so well, but if you want the compromises inherent in the tiny designs, don't buy this.UPDATE: After another week, I'm still totally excited about this product. a couple of days ago I ran a conference call from my cell phone, from the car.

The sound is muffled and you have increase the volume level to the max to even hear it. I used these headphones with my new sony ericsson w350. Though the sound is aweful, the functionality and dirt cheap price makes up for it. It's your basic handsfree one button headphones but the good part is it allows you to replace the headphones with any others as there is a jack at the end of the hands free. I have a seperate set of sony earbuds that sound amazing and used them on the handsfree. The sound quality jumped and allowed me to continue using hte hands free feature. The only draw back is it left a ton of wiring all over the place as my earbuds have a long cord to begin with and the hands free is almost as long. That was a big draw back but I dont fault these phones. I was extremely satisfied with this purchase despite the drawbacks and you just cant beat the price.VERY IMPORTANT: For those of you that care for looks, these phones did not come in silver as indicated in the 1st picture above.

That's it!Of course, any old phone will do that, but there's my image to look out for, so I also want it to look expensive and sleek, to be able to pick up signals even in office blocks, have long battery life, and have tons of cool features to talk about, even if I never use them.  The ability to withstand sudden impacts and the occasional passing shower is also an asset.So far, this phone has met all my needs as follows:(1) It makes calls just great(2) It receives calls clearly(3) It looks trendy with its cute little handle-shaped antenna, which is very useful as a handle when pulling it from your bag(4) It's not the most expensive, but it looks like a million bucks(5) It picks up signals in office buildings (and elsewhere)(6) Excellent battery life(7) It fell and survived  (JAN 16 - EDIT: IT FELL AGAIN AND THE INTERIOR DISPLAY IS DAMAGED.

While Motorola phones to come equipped with a voice recorders, the amount of memory that one is allowed to use for voice records is very limited.  With this phone, I can compose many short notes to myself, such as what items to buy from the grocery store, whom to call, what the license plate number was of the person who hit my car, etc.The phone's camera is also adequate for my purposes.  However, I'm not a big photo taker.  I have used the phone to document damage to my car (after I had a broken car window, for example).The data cable and free software pack is that you can download from Sony's website allow you to transfer images and sounds to and from the computer with relative ease, free of charge.One annoying feature of the phone: it takes a non-standard headset, charger, and data connection cable.  So, you cannot use handsets equipped with standard 2.5 mm connectors. unfortunately, I have not found a very good Bluetooth headset that works well with the phone.  So, one's best bet is to use the standard headset that comes with the phone.as previous reviewers have commented, the phone's screen does blank from time-to-time.It is difficult to use the voice-activated dial feature.  Recognition is very poor with this phone.  Motorola phones, in general, have slightly more sophisticated voice-activated dial features.It is also fairly easy to record conversations using the voice-recorder feature.  So, let's say you're on the phone with someone in the car, you don't need to have pen and paper in hand to take down addresses or phone numbers.  You can simply record the needed information and playback.  I often use this feature when I'm calling restaurants or merchants for addresses, telephone numbers, or directions.I've found that battery time is generally quite good.As with all cell phones, make sure you determine what features you want in advance, do your research, and purchase a phone that has all the features you want.I, for instance, am most interested in the voice-recorder that this flip phone is equipped with. I can live with the phone's other deficits.I would suggest going in to one or more stores to make the purchase, if possible.  I realize that is not always possible, particularly with phones that are not very popular or with unlocked phones, as in this case.nevertheless, if you do your research somewhat carefully and thoroughly, you can generally find a phone that meets your needs.","4.0","Serviceable","1172966400","03 4, 2007"

It holds my Droid X pretty securely with the adjustable sides that also have adjustable sliding arms that go up and down, so I do not have to have any of my buttons blocked.  The swivel section is very bendable, but it is stiff and will hold its shape well.  The side arms have a foam coating so they really grip my phone well once they are pushed in.  Releasing the phone is very easy too, you just push the button on the bottom and the side arms release the pressure and slide out allowing for easy retrieval of your phone or GPS unit.This unit is made to mount to the windshield or some other smooth surface.  I am in New Jersey and its illegal here to have anything attached to your windshield.  I do not have any smooth surfaces to attach the suction cup to my dash, so a little ingenuity was called for during my installation.  I took a flat piece of sheet metal, cut it about 4 inches square, sanded it, painted it, then did some light sanding with a very fine grit paper over the paint to make the surface absolutely smooth.  I then attached my custom built metal plate to my dash with some strips of double-stick tape.  Then I attached the suction cup to the plate and it holds very well.This is a very good mount and appears to be made very well.

Not sure what to attribute this to. Once again if you are trying to install on a cold windshield...forget it. The glass and suction cup have to be warm to get a good suction.Update 7/24/13 The mount worked as advertised until early July when I dropped it with the phone attached. Broke the side bracket. Purchased the exact same unit.Update 2/24/13 Still love the mount. Works flawlessly.I have only had the mount for a few days but it is better than anticipated. I drive for a living and have used the mount in 6 different vehicles. Works perfect in all. Easy and flexible to use in any vehicle. Have yet to have the suction demount. This should fit the Galaxy Note 2 without a problem.I've been using it for a couple weeks and still working great. If you live in a cold climate you may have issues with the suction. We went through a cold spell here in SoCal (40's) and it was more difficult to get the unit to suction. Once car warmed up, no issues.","5.0","So far...awesome.

First, the good: the mount is solid, it stays stuck to the glass, and the flexible arm bit is VERY stiff and hard to adjust but really stays put once you have it where you want it. Now, the not so great: the flexible arm seems to vibrate quite a bit while you drive, and the expanding bracket does not work as well as promised. In fact, the button on the side only seems to open the bracket if you have it rotated 90 degrees to the left (as in landscape, with the button pointing up). I took it apart and realized that this is because there is an assortment of rather cheap gears which rely on gravity to allow the button to only work in one direction. I much prefer my Grip Go, but if you need a longer mount and/or one with a bracket then this one isnt bad for the price, just not perfect.","4.0","Not perfect but good.","1384732800","11 18, 2013"

It's great for that.It's obvious the plastic or construction material allows it to fall out of tolerance, which means the ratchet action ceases to function.

I have counterparts in two remote offices and we spend a lot of time on the phone.  Trying to hold the cradle with my shoulder while I type is horrible--it slows me down and eventually hurts.  A headset like this is mandatory for me.I've used other headsets before.  This one is really good (although I've used other Plantronics models that were more comfortable).This unit plugs into your phone, either into the external jack that some phones have or in between your phone and your handset.  When you take a call, just take the handset off the hook and set it on your table, and then push the button on the headset to pick it up.  It works great.This headset has a 300' range, which is great if you have to move around while you talk.  I've walked down the hall to pick up a print job from the printer and never had any drop in call quality.I do have one complaint about the installation though.  The jack where you plug in your handset cable is very difficult to access.  There is a piece of plastic molding in front of it.  They built a little plastic ramp to make it easier to slide the plug in, but it gets hung up on a plastic lip.  It took me about 15 minutes of messing with it to finally get the plug into the jack.

The swivel to use the keypad is awful, no one can ever hear me when talking, (even when I use the Motorola H700 Bluetooth headset), photos taken on a regular megapixel camera phone are better than the 1.3 provided here, can't listen to MP3 thru bluetooth, photos stored on phone often become corrupted for no reason at all, all photos disappear occassionally and I have to turn phone off and back on, too bulky and heavy, battery at times drains after only an hour even without any use, reception very poor and often have to stand in wide open areas.  Overall, I am very disappointed with this phone and only wish my contract would allow me to trade it in.

Orchard I love lamp","[130, 135]","sony ericsson W600 reviewupdated note: phone has been sent back to the manufacturer twice now for bluetooth problems. upon thinking about this phone some more, i'd say the software is buggy for a lot of people. please take this into consideration before buying.i bought this phone in early december for the oh-so-NOT-low price of $390 from letstalk.com. i was (am) only about seven months into my two-year contract, so yes, i paid full price. :eek:in my past, i've owned most of the major brands of phones (motorola, nokia, samsung, sony ericsson, sharp) and right before i got this phone, i was a happy motorola V551 owner. initially, i had wanted the sony ericsson W800, but without the 850mhz band and being a cingular customer, i wasn't going to risk it.in short, i love this phone. to date, it's the best phone i've owned. i don't think it's worth the $390 i paid for it, but that's really my fault. i'm impatient and wanted this phone reeeeeally bad and didn't want to wait until it dropped in price (if it ever will). i am going to cover a few of the major components to this phone and then list some pros and cons. mine is a cingular-branded phone, so keep that in mind when i talk about certain features.camera: i've had a few camera phones before this one. i'll preface this section by saying what 100s of others have said: it's a camera PHONE. it's not going to have the quality to make even a decent 4X6 print. what it IS good for are those moments where you're thinking, oh! i wish i had a camera right now!. my last phone was a VGA camera and i thought by getting a phone with a 1.3 MP camera, it'd be a noticable difference. it isn't really. however, the cameras on phones are such a relative subject since once person can think the pic looks good and others think it looks like total doodie. i would urge you to look at samples of pics this phone has taken and judge for yourself. i wasn't too impressed, but that's not why i bought the phone. the camera has a lot of neat little options (special effects, white balance, shoot mode, night mode, self-timer, etc), but that's all kinda lost when the pictures aren't that great. it should be noted that the camera on this phone and the sony ericsson S710a (a phone very similar to the W600) are both 1.3MP, but the S710a has a CCD sensor, which results in better pics. the phone will also take little (albeit grainy) video clips. moving on...bluetooth: doesn't seem to be as easy to use as with my motorola, but i have some learning to do here. was what was cool was transferring ringtones from my friend's SE T616 to mine via bluetooth. free ringtones for me! i don't have bluetooth on any of my PCs, so i cannot comment on bluetooth connectivity in relation to that. i just like that the option (bluetooth) is there.walkman: holy crap, it's a MP3 player on my phone! the walkman is pretty easy to use and so is the software to transfer songs to your phone. it took me about 12 minutes to transfer 15 songs, so it's not incredibly fast, but it's a cool app, nonetheless. the phone can hold about 60-70 songs at 128bps (ripping at other bitrates is possible, allowing more/less songs to be stored on the phone), depending on what other stuff you have on your phone (pics, vids). the sound is pretty damn good. you can listen to MP3s from the speakers or via headphones. i was very impressed. the phone does NOT have a 3.5mm plug, but comes with an adapter, so all is well. i've even plugged this phone into my car's cassette adapter and played MP3s through the car's stereo speakers. MP3s can also be used as ringtones. all-in-all, no complaints here! well, except the 256MB limit.radio: nice little feature! you HAVE to have the headset plugged in to listen to the radio, as it acts as the antenna, but while it's plugged in, you can send the sound to come out of the speakers. radio is easy to use, channels are easy to store and radio sounds good. the radio (as well as the MP3 player), will pause if you get a call and resume when you're done. you can also use the radio and MP3 player while doing other things on the phone. headphones sound awesome.games: the phone came with six games: asphalt3D, blockbreaker, bruwnswick billiards, jewel quest, name that tune, tetris, and 3D extreme air snowboarding. all games are locked, so you can only play them for about a minute and then you are prompted to purchase them. they are $6-$8, roughly. total rip off. thanks cingular.ringtones: again, thanks to cingular, there are only six ringtones that come with this phone, and they are pretty crappy. there are free ones all over the place, so don't go spending your inheritance on buying them from cingular. or, do as i do and grab them off another SE phone via bluetooth. there is a little app including on the phone called musicDJ and you can actually make your own ringtones. kinda cool. i've made a few so far and they aren't bad. well, ok, my mom said they sounded horrible, but what does she know?syncing: this phone syncs with your contacts, tasks, notes and calendar, if you have those kinds of programs on your PC. i got my phone to sync with my outlook, which now means i'll sell my PDA. SE's PC suite works pretty well and transferring files is easy. however, it seems like every now and again, when i am connected via USB, it reboots my phone. don't know what that's about. i don't think any harm is being done.the phone feels pretty solid in your hand, weight-wise. i've never owned a slider/swivel phone in my life, and while it's not the most convenient to flip open, it's not bad. you can actually place and receive calls with the phone swivelled shut, too, which i liked.it seems like SE didn't leave anything out with this phone (except a memory slot) and i love it. they thought of everything on this phone: radio, little flash light, dedicated key lock button, infrared, calendar, music/video/picture DJ,stopwatch, timer, tasks, notes and the list goes on and on. the phone's styling (ie: orange cover) isn't for everyone, but i love it. my phone did come with a 2nd cover, in navy blue. it's styling and shape is great and i love the orange backlit keypad. it's definitely a head-turner.and, above all, reception and clarity of calls is great. i've had no complaints when i've used the phone, the headset, the bluetooth headset and speakerphone. it's really nice. this of course, can be dependent on your network. i live in the midwest in a fairly large area (260K people), so we have cell towers all over the place.pros:* nice size.* bluetooth, infrared and speakerphone.* radio and MP3s* clarity of calls is excellent. reception is great.* screen is nice and bright.* easy to get pics, vids, etc. on and off the phone.* phone comes with everything you need (except car charger)* this phone is loaded - nothing is left out!* sony ericsson's interface is great; apps like the address book are loaded with room for tons of info. menus are easy to use.cons:* no memory slot. on-board memory, while not bad, is limited to 256MB.* price (well, at full retail anyway).* camera is disappointing for a 1.3MP.* phone goes into standby (screen off) after 15 seconds. very annoying and to date, i've found no way to change that.* games are locked for only 1 minute of play. thanks cingular ;( not ONE free game is included.* keypad buttons are small, and close together. i have small hands, so the key size is not so bad, it's the fact that they are right next to each other.this is a great phone. its big disappointment is the fixed 256MB memory, but for a lot of people who just want to listen to a few songs and not 500, this phone will suit you just fine. i am hoping to keep this phone for more than six months (which is about how often i get a new cell phone) - it has everything i need and nothing i don't. kudos to sony ericsson for putting out a great phone! woo! ;)","5.0","best phone i've owned. seriously. it rocks. go buy it. :)","1133740800","12 5, 2005"
"ARXU3FESTWMJJ","B000C1CHVC","Mary Jo Sminkey 15 years of Amazon Reviews!","[17, 19]","I did a lot of research on phones before finally settling on the W600i phone. I really didn't need an MP3 player as I usually carry a PDA with me as well, but the features on this phone were just too good to pass up. I considered a Motorola RAZR but saw a lot of complaints about battery life. Well, no problems here! I've previously been using a SE T616 which had superb battery life, and this phone is equally as good. Which is certainly important if you do plan to use it as a music player.First things first...entering phone numbers. So tedious on most phones, and something I always dread. Thankfully, the W600i came with software to sync with Outlook. It took me a little while to figure out the syncing software. When you hook the phone up to USB, it can go into phone mode or file mode and for some reason the software always tells me it can't find the phone if it is in file mode. So to sync, I had to put it in phone mode. Turns out file mode was used only for transferring MP3s. Still tells me it can't find the phone, yet the transfer did work! Sometimes when I plug it in, my computer won't see it without rebooting, which cost me a lot of time and aggravation trying to figure out as well. So somewhat annoying implementation here, but such a time saver, and something I've never had before at all with a phone, so it's hard to gripe. I usually don't bother to put appointments and tasks on my cell phone, but since they just sync with Outlook, now that's easy to do as well. This may not be a SmartPhone, but it could replace a PDA for casual users.The MP3 player is decent enough. Sound quality was much better than I expected. Then I tried the built-in FM radio. Wow, awesome reception here! The cord acts as an antennae so you have to be sure to unwind it for best results, but considering how far from the stations I am, I was quite impressed with how nice it sounded. Some simple equalizer settings, nothing special. Only gripe would be the lack of an external memory card, there's certainly room for one so it should have been added. I guess Sony's proprietary Memory Stick would be large to squeeze in, so rather than add a SD slot, they just left it out completely. Booo to that.Phone data features worked great. I got even better reception on the W600i than my T616 and now also have Edge. Had no problems using Bluetooth to connect up to my PDA and laptop, and speeds were pretty nice. The Media Net services worked fast and there were some nice demo services included as well. Not sure I will pay for these but definitely worth considering.Camera is better than most cell phone cameras I have used, but still nothing great. The pseudo-flash is at least an attempt to improve indoor shots but any real camera still beats the pants off it. You can even use the little flash-light as an SOS beacon if you get lost. ;-) Even better is the image import included with the PC software. Was nice to easily copy over GOOD photos to use for my contacts.To use the keypad, you have to swivel the back of the camera down. It makes a cool little sound and lights up, but it's not the easiest motion to do one-handed and will also make getting a decent playthrough case a lot harder than other phones. The buttons are easy to press though, an improvement over my old T616. There are also a couple buttons at the top of the screen that confused me as to their function (of course, I don't bother with manuals!) I did figure out that they were used when playing games in landscape mode. Neat idea. There were a couple bugs in the OS as well. When using voice dial, an misrecognized command results in a really weird and annoying sound coming from the phone. And the voice command symbols in the address book are very buggy...appearing and disappearing from the contacts that don't have them. Hopefully a phone firmware upgrade will fix these.This is the first cell phone I've had with a real speakerphone. You really can use it without having to hold it up to your ear...assuming you are someplace it won't disturb other users. You can play music through the speaker as well, and use those MP3s as alarms and phone sounds, so lots of things to play with here. For some reason a lot of the phone tones you can buy through Cingular are not available for this phone yet, but hopefully they will get those working soon. I also had trouble downloading a couple games I purchased.Some users have reported issues with using bluetooth headsets, particularly with voice control. I'm not a fan of having another device I have to charge all the time, so I prefer using a regular handfree. And this phone actually comes with one for free! The headphones double as a handsfree headset in addition to the FM antennae, so it's well worth carrying and using over a bluetooth headset, IMO.I was able to get both my PDA and my laptop to pair up with it and use it as a modem for internet connection, although my laptop was a bit flaky and did require a bluetooth upgrade and reboot to get it working. Great speed difference with the Edge network! According to Windows, I was getting 400Kbps, with my old phone it was usually around 100Kbps. The phone has a nice E symbol that tells you when you are on Edge, and G for regular GPRS. Even in my house out here in the country I am able to get Edge, which was a pleasant surprise. I haven't traveled much yet, but it looks like they already have pretty good coverage, and metro areas in particular shouldn't be an issue.So, this may not be the smallest, lightest phone out there. There are definitely some issues like the weird swivel design, voice dial bugs and lack of memory card support that may be cause for complaint. But if your priorities are a phone with great battery life, excellent reception, Edge and bluetooth, and easy to use, this one should definitely be at the top of your list. If you don't already have  a portable MP3/FM player, I don't see how you could even consider anything else! I've yet to find the perfect phone, but this one comes so close to it and is so much better than the other phones I've had, I have to give it 5 stars.","5.0","Best phone I've owned!","1135209600","12 22, 2005"

At least I was able to keep my number and swap the old SIM into the new phone.Overall I'm fairly happy with the 8700c. I miss the five-way joystick: navigating in Google Maps is a bit awkward. (Alt+scrollwheel for side-to-side). The keyboard is OK, but . should have a dedicated key. I find the phone sound OK, although some people that I call report high noise levels.The biggest issue is switching between silent/vibrate and ring modes. The Treo gets this right: there is a simple, easily visible, sliding switch. You can see instantly what mode you're in, and can switch into silent mode without even removing the Treo from its holster.On the Blackberry I have to unlock it (using my password) and get back to the main menu screen just to SEE what mode I'm in (interpreting a small multicoloured icon). If I need to switch modes I then have to scroll to the Profiles applet, select it, choose the right profile, and apply it - a total of 15-20 key presses and wheel scroll events.  This simply sucks. Since I try to be polite and avoid phone interruptions during meetings, I wind up leaving the device on vibrate only, which means that occasionally I miss a call.RIM really needs to fix this. I can't imagine that anyone else has patented the idea of a mute switch....UPDATE, 2/10/07: The usability issues that I mentioned, plus the lack of third-party applications finally got to me. My employer just added support for Windows Mobile devices, so I've replaced my 8700c with a Cingular 8525.","4.0","Not bad... but one REALLY annoying design glitch","1160352000","10 9, 2006"

"A3UCF82XIPJME2","B000C1DOU0","Jones itimbuktu","[44, 45]","The Blackberry 8700 is wonderful! It does a great job of retrieving email from all five of my accounts, and functions well as a phone and PDA. I am thrilled.Until two weeks ago, I was carrying around a top of the line Dell Axim X30 with 624 MHZ and wireless capability, and a cell phone. I teach at several universities and do consulting work so I have five different email accounts and I'm constantly checking my email at least twice an hour. Prior to getting this Blackberry, I had to find a wireless spot to use my Axim, stay tied to my laptop, or pay out the nose for web access on my cell phone. It was terrible.Now with the Blackberry, all of my email accounts are programmed in so I'm instantly notified when I get a message. Because I can respond within seconds, I never miss a beat. My students and clients often comment that I respond quickly to their needs, which they love. The 8700 from Cingular has GSM and dual band service so I can be almost anywhere in the world and still receive my email messages instantly. I was in Hong Kong last week and the Blackberry functioned flawlessly. I could use it as a phone in HK and also receive and reply to email.Additionally, I love the fact that I can synch my MS Outlook calendar, contacts, address book, tasks, etc. to the Blackberry. (It also has the ability to synch with other PIM programs.) I have mine set to sound an alarm 15 mins before I'm due in a meeting or appt and it has been a life saver. When you are always on the go, it's easy to forget stuff. This Blackberry makes it easy to keep everything in one place. Oh, and surfing the web is a breeze. The display is a nice size and it's crisp and clear and shows almost all websites easily.Lastly, I love the size of the 8700. I thought it would be a bit bulky but it's not. This version is about the same size as the 7290 Blackberry and fits nicely in your hand.My only two complaints are that some of the buttons and functions are not immediately intuitive, and RIM has yet to come out with an assortment of cases for this version. But, after about 15 mins of playing around, I was able to figure out just about everything (the manual that RIM provides covers only the basics), and I found a great case on eBay.I only wish I had discovered Blackberry sooner!","5.0","Awesome Blackberry!","1138233600","01 26, 2006"
"A952LJOXPLTVL","B000C1DOU0","K. Allen Cram34","[22, 24]","Pretty much the same features as the 7290 but with a great screen and speakerphone.Pros:-Screen is perfect.-Speaker phone is the best I have ever heard.-Call quality and volume is excellent-The 2 short cut keys and call keys are a great edition.-Nice form factor.Cons:-Nothing really new added.-Battery life is crap.-No option for camera-Internet has EDGE but to be honest there is no noticable diff in speed.  Maybe a sec or two. Get EV-DO if you want speed.-Internet software has problems surfing and opening some links.-The case of the 7290 and build quality is in my mind what made it so popular.  When they came out with the 7100 series it was a joke.  The first of the series anyway.  No experience with the newer ones.The 8700c is well made but has two major problems.  One the screen is moved up to the surface of the phone(not indented).  The screen also is smoothed out and extends to the top of the phone.  Making a nice slick look but easy to scratch in the long run.The 2nd major build quality issue is the grey casing.  Why phone companies do this is a mystery to me.  Its not the fact that its grey but the fact that the actual case is black but painted grey.  So cany scratch or dent will show black on the grey case.  Makes it stand out more.  I have dropped and beat up my 7290 so much but none of this really shows. If you are new to blackberry or have to buy another one this 8700c is it.  But if you have a working older model its not worth the upgrade.Also check out the Treo 700w although not sure how the push email compares with blackberry yet.","4.0","Better and worse","1136419200","01 5, 2006"
"A33FS5H3CPDR6D","B000C1DOU0","Miguel Ali Film Director & Political Pundit","[41, 42]","I often hear debates over who has the better smartphone --- Palm or BlackBerry??I have two lines with Sprint PCS, with my personal line having a Treo 700p and my business line connected to a BlackBerry 8703First off - I love both phones! However, they are very different, particularly in their strengths and weaknesses --- my review is based upon how well each smartphone handles the following things -- PHONE FUNCTIONS- EMAIL- INTERNET- PHOTOGRAPHS- MULTIMEDIA (Music & Movies)- SPEAKERPHONE- BLUETOOTH- COMPUTER SYNCHRONIZATION- MISC - (Text Messaging, System Stability, PDA Functions)Okay..... here we go -1. PHONE FUNCTIONSFor me, the Treo 700p has much better phone functions --- this is mostly because of their touch screen capabilitiesWhen I wanna dial a number off of the Treo, I immediately start spelling the person's name on the keyboard, and I immediately go to my phone book, where I can touch the number I want to dialThe BlackBerry is a bit more complicated, as I cannot touch the screen --- therefore, I'm limited to dialing based upon scrolling to the right name and then pressing the numberOverall, the BlackBerry isn't bad ---- however, I know a lot of people like to use their phone while driving their car (with a bluetooth headset on) or like to use the phone in situations that require a quick reaction.... if you wanna use your phone in the car, then the Treo is the best choice, mainly because the touch screen allows one to go to any name and dial immediately --- as funny as this sounds, you can really only use a BlackBerry, for phone calls, in situations when you can give it total devotionWith that said.... if you are not dialing numbers while driving in the car, then the BlackBerry's phone functions are fine.... they take a bit longer to get going, due to scrolling.... but they get the job done just fine (and yes, you can use the keyboard to look up names in the address book, as well)2. EMAILOkay - this is really the only category where the BlackBerry really beats up the Treo 700 and beats it up GOOD!!!First off, email on the Treo 700p is no totally useless.... the Treo comes with VersaMail, a program that handles all POP, IMAP, and other email accounts with ease..... there's also a program available called CHATTER EMAIL for the Treo, which makes the Treo's email functions even faster and more versatileHowever, the big problem with Treo email is that one has to download the email --- in other words, you have to log onto ChatterMail or VersaMail and wait for a few mins as the program downloads all of the email you've received --- now you can configure a program like ChatterMail to be constantly downloading your email, so one receives it immediately, however this is a BAD choice because such a function basically keeps the Treo on a 'constant' phone call, as it downloads email --- in turn, your cell phone mins get eaten up, battery life goes down quickly, and phone calls are missed do to your phone being occupied on the 'other line'THe BlackBerry, on the other hand, downloads all of your emails immediately, without draining the battery, without interrupting phone calls, and without eating up your cell phone mins --- my BlackBerry can download my emails more immediately than my own laptopIn addition, the BlackBerry 8703 keyboard is absolutely awesome --- so I much more prefer to write emails over my BlackBerry than I do over my Treo 700pIn summary on this one, the BlackBerry is clearly much better with email.... and if email is the most important thing to you, then go BlackBerry for sure! --- however, the Treo 700p holds its own with email, provided that you are willing to wait and download your emails over something like Chatter or Versamail3. INTERNETBoth phones handle internet similarly, however, I would give the edge to the Treo 700p mostly because of the TOUCHSCREEN, as it allows one to navigate webpages with more freedomThat said, the BlackBerry is fien too, just a bit more limitedBoth phones can connect your laptop to the internet, depending on your cell service --- I've been very pleased with the Treo's ability to connect my laptop to the internet, provided that I use its USB cable with the program USB MODEM ----- I don't have as much experience doing this with my BlackBerry, but I have heard that the results are favorable when doing soEVDO speeds on both phones are very good4. PHOTOGRAPHSIf pictures are important, then the Treo 700p is the CLEAR winnerThe Treo 700p comes with a great multimedia program, fueld by an embedded Kinoma player, which can allow you to show off pictures with pretty good easeI'm a Mac user, so I use MarkSpace to get my pics onto my Treo and I'm very pleased with the Treo's ability to show off pictures --- the resolution and quality are shown off very wellI have yet to get pictures onto my BlackBerry though --- I have seen other friends of mine show off pictures on their BlackBerry, but the program does not seem as sophisticated or as user friendly as Palm'sClearly, the Treo 700p is made to handle pics, whereas the BlackBerry is lagging in this area5. MULTIMEDIA (Movies/Music)I am actually DEEPLY impressed with how well the Treo 700p can handle multimedia, both music and moviesI am a filmmaker myself --- with the use of the program, KINOMA PRODUCER, I have compressed many of my short films to small files, for the purposes of showing them off of my Treo to some friends --- the Treo 700p plays the files excellently, with sound coming out of the speakerphone and the resolutions of the films looking excellent!Even better is that the Treo 700p can handle MP4's and MPEG4's, allowing me to encode the best resolution and best sounding files onto my Treo ---- sadly, the Treo 700p cannot play songs downloaded from the iTunes Music Store, as those are copyright protected, but it will play anything that one encodes with my own devicesThe music/mp3 player on the Treo is also excellent, playing tunes through the speakerphone, or through the headphones that the Treo comes withAs far as I can tell, the BlackBerry 8703 does not have any multimedia functions, so good luck getting an MP4 or MPEG4 onto this thing ---- however, Blackberry is working on this, so future BlackBerry's will have this capability --- but if playing movies and music is important to you, then the Treo 700p is the only choice in this departmentLastly - important to include that the Treo 700p also has a built in camera and a built in camcorder --- and the camcorder movies taken on the Treo are actually pretty good quality! --- the BlackBerry 8703 has no camera and no camcorder6. SPEAKERPHONEThe Speakerphone on both phones is excellent and easy to use, with both being loud and clearIf speakerphone is your main buying point, then you couldn't go wrong with either phone7. BLUETOOTHBluetooth is very solid on both phonesI've been especially pleased with the Treo 700p, whose BlueTooth capabilities are much more solid and stable than the old Treo 650pThe BlackBerry seems to have few problems connecting with my bluetooth headset and other devices ---- I would say that both phones boast great bluetooth capabilities8. COMPUTER SYNCHROIt's important to note that I have a MAC and I sync all my phones off of my MacFor the Treo 700p, I use MarkSpace's Missing Sync, as Palm's software is terribleFor the BlackBerry, BB has launched free Mac-Syncing software, that can be found on their websiteSyncing any smartphone off of a Mac is never an easy thing and I've not been too happy with the processWith that said, I'm pleased with MarkSpace's Missing Sync as, for the most part, the program does a good job of syncing my Treo's contacts and calendars, as well as doing photos and music --- unfortunately, the syncing process seems to take forever (usually at least 35 mins) but syncing once a week isn't a big dealI was pleased with how well the BlackBerry synced to my Mac, however, none of the email addresses for my contacts have transferred --- so there are some kinks to work out, and it could be that I'm just not syncing it rightMain point - both phones sync fine with the Mac, but expect some minor probs --- however, for what its worth, I'm pretty satisified overall9. MISC - (Text Messaging, System Stability, PDA Functions)It is important to note that the BlackBerry is MUCH MORE stable than the Treo 700p --- I have had my BlackBerry shut down on me once in the last few months, whereas the Treo 700p probably shuts down once a weekSo if stability is important, than the BlackBerry is the way to goThe calendar and address book functions of both phones are excellent, but I would say that the Treo 700p's PDA functions are a 'bit' betterBoth phones are fine with text messaging, as well--- CONCLUSION ---If I could only use ONE of these phones, then I would definitely pick the Treo 700p --- the reasons why are because the multimedia functions very much impress me, as I like to store some pics and movies on thereIn addition, the phone functions are easier to navigate and the touchscreen is something that I couldn't live without on a daily basis --- text messaging, bluetooth, and PDA functions are all excellent, as well, with email being the only thing that lags (but even that's not so bad)However, I love the BlackBerry's solid system and its excellent email performanceHaving one as my personal cellphone and the other as my business setup is the perfect balance --- however, I would give the slight edge to the Treo 700pWith that said --- if you want multimedia and other phone functions, in addition to better phone functions, then the Treo 700p is your phoneIf you are all business and clearly value EMAIL over multimedia, then the BlackBerry may be your best betHope that helpsPEACE AND LOVE & HAPPY BUYING!!!!Muhammad Ali Hasan","5.0","The Ultimate TREO vs BLACKBERRY review!!!","1167091200","12 26, 2006"

For the almost $50 price tag i thought it would be better quality since it was the step up from the entry level bluetooth.  I also havent found how to put it on the left ear yet, i feel like i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off.I would recommend spending another $40 and buying the Jawbone bluetooth.

The features are good, but one must remember certain button combinations for extended features (like press two buttons at the same time to mute the microphone).  The battery life is good.  A significant issue is that it picks up surrounding noise better than the person's voice who is taking, which means that it often can't be used.

"A1ZM846Y7AUYD","B000CORUSO","M. Pickering","[6, 6]","First of all I just want to say, this low cost Bluetooth headset is a great value.  There are a lot of Bluetooth heasets to choose from on the market today.  Many are more stylish and have more bells and whistles, but for under $30.00 this headset is one of the best values out there.  This pink version is very cute and offers a perfect color match for the Versizon V3 series Motorola Pink Razr.  However, I believe the gentle pink color is the only stylish element of this headset.  Take away the pink and you are left with a very generic looking earpiece.Now lets talk about performance.  The H500 couldn't be eaiser to use.  It paired with my daughter's Verizon Motorola Pink Razr in just seconds, and the button configuration of this unit makes perfect sense.  The buttons have gentle action yet offer a satisfying click feel when pushing them; not mushy feeling at all.  The sound quality of the speaker is quite good but not acceptional.  The voice quality of the microphone is very impressive.  When I am on the phone with my daughter, she actually sounds much better with this headset than when using the Razr phone alone.  It does tend to pickup a great deal of background noise though, so it may not be the best in noisey environments.  The H500 sits in a very stable manner on my daughters ear.  The ear hook is soft and flexible and can be worn for extended periods without discomfort.  It does not look or feel as if it will fall off your ear even when tipping your head.I am giving this headset a full 5 stars.  I do not rate the H500 so highly for its outstanding style, but rather for its simple functionality, solid performance, great build quality and overall value for the money.  You just can't get a better Bluetooth headset for under $30.00!  I highly recommend this headset for any woman that is looking for a cute color match to her Verizon Moto Razr, while also seeking a comfortable fit and impressive performance.  There may be better looking headsets out there, but you'll likely suffer penalties in cost and/or performance.","5.0","Pretty In Pink - Good Looks, Stable Performance and Outstanding Value!","1197936000","12 18, 2007"

The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.

That doesn't seem to affect call quality or volume but it feels a little floppy that way.It does probably make wearing it for a long time more comfortable.  It is small enough to forget about and since your ear isn't plugged the outside noises sound like it's not there.For the problem where the mic gets blocked, I've noticed that the more horizontal I make it, the more it sits off the face.  If I turn it so that it is more vertical it moves the mic closer to the skin.  But that'll vary by user due to ear shape.Pairing with my Razr was very easy.  I tried with a V600 as well and again no problems.  Call quality is good and I can walk into the next room and still have no problems with the call.  Haven't tested the max effective range, but I can walk around the aparment and it does seem to meet specifications.

Christensen Frequent traveler, business o...","[160, 171]","I use this unit with my Palm Treo 700w, which has a pretty lousy BT radio, so that may explain part of the reason why the range is so awful with this headset.  Max range with clear line of sight is about 6 feet, but usually less then 24 inches.  It is barely usable if the phone is on my waist in its holster.  Major disappointment.  My Jabra BT250 is better with the Treo, but not hugely so.My biggest problem with this headset is that people are constantly telling me that they can't hear me.  I have to lift the mic boom away from my cheek and then they will say Ah! Much better!.  When that is only the case while I stand there like a dork with one hand holding the mic boom away from my cheek and the other hand holding the phone within a foot of my head.  This looks pretty silly walking down an airport terminal, and rather defeats the purpose of having a headset in the first place...I'll say this, though - the H700 performs the feature that I was looking for which was so bad with the Jabra BT250 - it actually stays on my ear.  I have small ear lobes, and the Jabra won't stay put - if I lean down it falls off.  The H700 stays on very well, and you hardly notice it is even there.  Very comfortable!Too bad the mic gets blocked by my cheek, which makes it worthless about 50% of the time.**Update 5/11/2006**- solution to muffled sound problem...I trimmed a tiny piece of adhesive-backed felt (the kind you put under bowls/vases, etc. you will have on your coffee table)and placed it on the little gray bump on the boom, just behind the tiny mic opening. This creates an air gap between the mic opening and your cheek - problem solved!A great headset with pretty good reception and wonderful form factor. 5 stars if they fix the mic hole clearance problem!","3.0","Nice small package, good features, less than perfect performance","1143158400","03 24, 2006"

Buttons are few and easy to use, main button is a bit sensitive. USB charging is a real plus.Aesthetics: A, like most Moto products, it's an attractive piece (though a bit odd). Some color options would be welcome.Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight, but the ear clip pinches a bit. (The old HS850 was actually a bit more comfortable.) Stablity of fit is very good but not perfect.Compatibility: B+, no problems pairing. Flip boom connects / disconnects quickly, but only when your (non-Motorola) phone is in standby mode; the stated RapidConnect technology for answering calls appears to be a Motorola-only feature. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use. However, it occasionally emits a soft beep that has yet to be resolved.Outbound sound quality: B+, callers can hear me fine, but some have complained of a speakerphone quality to the sound. Decent noise cancellation with no echo.Inbound sound quality: B-, volume is improved and adequate, but could be a bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but lack bass.

It is loud enough that I can hear in my rather noisy car without a problem. No one I've talked to has complained about the sending sound quality at all--most didn't know I was using a headset. Pairing was simple and worked according to the instructions.The headset fits me well, doesn't have any problem with my glasses, isn't particularly noticable when I'm wearing it. The buttons are logical and work well.The charger is the same as the RAZR charger (same voltage/current and connector), so now I have two chargers that can be used with either device...and can charge the headset using the car charger I got with the RAZR. This is very handy! I think that the charger compatability should seal the deal for RAZR users--in my opinion, this is definitely the Bluetooth headset to get if you have a RAZR.The only negative is that the manual, like the manual for my RAZR phone, is imcomplete. For instance, although the container says that you can pair with up to eight devices, I could not figure out how to pair with additional devices, nor how to switch between devices. I wish Motorola would invest in the writing and production of proper manuals--or at least to make the full manual accessible on the web, if they don't want to clutter the manual for most people with features most folks won't use.Oh...and I'd also like to be able to wear the thing without having to put it in Standby mode...but given how little energy Standby mode uses, that's not a really big deal.

Little pieces everywhere.The H700 - Finally a good quality headset!  Callers have no problems hearing me...  I have no problem hearing them while on the road.  I have a quiet car, but always found myself pressing a headset into my ear in order to hear conversations.  Not the case with the H700.  This thing has volume galore!  In fact, I had to bump it down a few ticks, works great at highway speeds.  It's comfortable... (unbelievably light) you think the 850 is small....  the 700 is truly 30% smaller as Moto claims.  When closed, this thing can hide behind a .50 cent piece.  Buttons are easy to operate by feel.  Anyone who uses a headset regularly knows that adjusting opposing buttons can be challenging - Not with the H700.  There is a place top or bottom to rest a finger if you need to adjust up or down easily.  Pairing and setup took 1 minute.  Sound for me is crystal clear.  This thing has all the bells and whistles.

I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. I find it easier to use the folding boom to turn it on/off when dropping it in a pocket rather than using a button like on most other models. The big issue for me was the muffled sound, both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse.

I have both a RAZR and Blackberry that I carry with me everywhere.

But if that's not an issue, then both are equal IMHO.Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and you'll blame it on the bluetooth!TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you!  You will still be able to close the boom.","5.0","FIX for the CHEEK Problem!!","1182470400","06 22, 2007"

My previous experiences with that were not very satisfying back in the day of earbuds and dangling wires. But, with a new cellphone came Bluetooth wireless capability, which opened up a new world of options.I had played with a number in the store, but didn't get any real world experience with them. But, I really liked the design and feel of the H700. I did some research - much of it through reviews here on Amazon; this left me a bit skeptical as there were many unfavorable reviews written here - they mentioned negatives like poor sound quality, minimum range, and Bluetooth connective problems to name a few. But, I decided to side with some other review I had read and the positive reviews on Amazon.The bottom line is I am very happy with my H700. I have experienced absolutely no problems - the people I have talked to all can hear me fine, and I can hear them; I have had the H700 up to 7 feet from my phone with no reception problems; and the H700 was easy to setup with my phone (LG VX8300) and immediately connects whenever I turn the device on.Feature-wise, the H700 is great! The buttons are easy to use and understand and the flip mic is great idea...the phone rings, just flip it open (keep it closed to conserve power) and the call is answered immediately; flip it closed to end the call and it powers down as well. The H700 also features a button for answering and ending calls if you don't want to power down the unit.I highly recommend the Motorola H700 as your Bluetooth headset choose - I have yet to find a negative about it.","5.0","Very Pleased with the Motorola H700","1167350400","12 29, 2006"

Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic.

I also liked that both units are small.  Thus, you don't look like you are on your way to a Star Trek convention while you are wearing them.While I liked the JX10's design over the BH-800, it had trouble understanding my voice commands.  I use Microsoft Voice Command with my XV6700 PocketPC phone.  I had to speak to the JX10 very slow and clearly to achieve only a 50% success rate in it understanding my commands the first try and subsequent tries.  The BH-800 understands my commands closer to 90% on the first try and 99% on the second try.The JX10 was comfortable in my ear without the earloop.  It never came close to falling out- it passed the head tilt test and the bend over test.  With the earloop, however, I could barely hear the unit.  The earloop prevents the unit from coming close enough to the ear.Pros:1. Good audio quality.  People can clearly hear me and I can clearly hear them.2. It's small.  It's less geeky than some headsets.3. Nice look and button layout.4. Charge cradle and USB charging is a nice bonus.Cons:1.

My conversation partners could hear me just fine (surprise, because I didn't believe into microphones being in my ear instead of close to my mouth).- It can supposedly be worn with or without the ear clip (hook).- Very nice, fashionable and sophisticated design for a graceful lady or a slower moving person (my sudden moves in the gym, car or with my little daughter sometimes knock this set out of my ear)CONS:- Incoming sound has a great deal of static unless the phone is very next to the set (it's so bad that when I decide to change the ear, I have to move the phone to the same side of the body)- Volume level is too low for city dwellers, unless I forcefully press it hard against and into my ear.- It doesn't fit well and stick inside my earlobe with or without the plastic hook:With the hook it sticks out a bit and doesn't fit into the ear as close,Without the hook it falls off too easily and too often (if you think the problem is in my ears, on one occasion a plastic surgeon chose me as an example to demonstrate that nobody's ears are perfect because I was physically closest to him, but then he changed his mind.)  I choose to wear it without the hook because it fits better into my ear but I'd never ride my bike or do any sudden movements without the hook.- It's so light that I don't feel it if it falls off- For the above reasons I definitely don't recommend it for sporty and fast moving individualsBottom line: Nice and fashionable set for people who don't move much and won't use it outside or in noisy areas.","3.0","Nice, but not for noisy environments or sports","1180828800","06 3, 2007"

SOUND QUALITY OUTBOUND --- I called my own voicemail and talked into it, while wearing this headset --- not only did it sound great in my regular voice, but I could even hear myself whispering (yes, I tested that too) --- so don't believe those who say that people on the other end will not hear you --- outbound sound quality wise, its the best headset out there, as I heard no static, no drop-outs, and no tunnel effects2. SIZE --- easily, this is the most comfy headset out there --- it is optional to attach it to your ear, and wear it without the loop --- honestly, the loop holds it in place much better, with no discomfort one bit --- yes, you can wear it without the loop, and it will hold okay, but either way is fine --- the thing is TINY which is neat3. CALL PICK UP --- call pick up happens instaneous, with a half a second delay --- no manual initiation necessary4. BATTERY and CHARGER --- the battery seems to hold just fine all day --- and the charger is real small --- the package also includes a USB charger, so that you can charge it over USB on your computer, which I thought was pretty useful for people on the roadOther pros would be that the RANGE seems pretty solid, and PAIRING was easy (I liked that JABRA created a SEPERATE pairing button)I would consider VOLUME a pro --- it would be nice if it was louder --- however, I can hear everyone just fine, provided that I'm indoors (whether that be in the office, in the car, etc) --- it can hold its own outdoors, but if you use your headset a lot outside, then you may wanna test run the JX10 first --- I think the Cardo Scala 500 had the LOUDEST volume, and the JX10 comes very close to that loudnessCONS ---1. BUTTONS --- this is really a MINOR complaint --- I think the button placement (accepting calls, ending calls) could be a little better - but its not a big deal, and certainly, not a deal breaker --- the thing is so small, that its kinda hard to fit any buttons on it anywayshonestly --- can't think of any other consThe headset is definitely the best looking --- silver with black streaks!I love this headset, and its gonna be awhile until its unseatedyes, the price is steep, but its worth it --- take my word for itthank you for reading and HAPPY BUYING!!!!!","5.0","Pleasently Surprised - the Best BT Headset Out There","1138406400","01 28, 2006"

Initially the headset hanging on one ear was a little uncomfortable, but within days I was walking out of the office forgetting I was even wearing it.  The range at the building I work is less than 100 feet, not a problem for my use.

Been using the standard Plantronics corded headset for years on my old ATT 4 line business phone. I finally got tired of the corded limitations and researched this unit online.Basically the system installs nicely and the handset lifter is included($39 value)at the Amazon price. My older phone supports a headset but is not configured for the newer headset connection option which this Plantronics unit also supports. The lifter is simple to install and powered from the Plantronics headset recharger base. Handset and speakerphone capabilities are not affected by installation of the lifter device under the handset. You can use your phone handset if your earpiece is still charging or be really lazy and just use the speakerphone if your situation allows that.With the lifter installed you simply put the headset on your ear, push a button on the earpiece and the lifter raises the phone hand set about 1/2 inch out of the cradle and your line becomes active. Then dial your number or hit the your speed dialer on whatever phone you are hooking the system to. What really clinches the deal on this system is that you can use your older desk telephone without having to spend additional funds on a landline phone set.Wireless frequencies-The new wireless frequency standard is extremely clear and static free with my office Netgear N900 and DLink N-Wireless routers up and running without any equipment or frequency conflicts that plague the older systems that may have caused major problems in the past. During my test calls and walking around testing in the house the voice quality and signal was crystal clear at all times.Good installation instruction manual and online help if you need it make this a real snap to install. Let the headset charge in the base for 3 hours and you will be up and running for 10 hours of talk time if you need it..............Plantronics CS55/HL10 Wireless Headset BundlePlantronics is not the cheapest but it is one of the best and it JUST WORKS!!!!!","5.0","Plantronics cs55/HL10 is awesome for new and old deskphones","1325894400","01 7, 2012"

Range is easily 50 ft+  I like to pace while I talk on tough calls, and this unit is flawless for that!  ;)---The Plantronics CS55 is a nice desk-based bluetooth unit.  I use it on an Inter-Tel phone system at work.  The body of the unit connects to your telephone line, an AC adapter, and a unit that sits on your phone to lift up the receiver during calls.  So there are a lot of wires, but you can tuck it away at the edge of your desk.  The ear piece, which charges on the main unit body, is pretty hefty and I generally have a hard time getting to hang on my ear securely. But it is flexible and after a few moments of adjustment, it stays pretty well but still wobbles around a bit.  Earpiece quality is very good.  For speaking into the unit, you will need to recrd yourself at different mouthpiece placements (e.g., talk call in to your own voice mail).  The mic picks up lots of noise (rustling of clothes, breathing, drinking, etc.), so it is good t be aware of how these are being heard by doing some testing.  Good voice quality, but watch those extra noises that yo might not be used to thinking about on a normal phone handset.  Good unit, works fine.","5.0","Invaluable for conference calls, long calls, webinars","1300320000","03 17, 2011"

It is much more sturdy, with the headset resting very comfortably in the charging unit.  My old one would 'float' once in a while and not charge when I thought it was, which meant I couldn't use it the next day until it charged for a while.  Not so with this unit.I had a behind the head band I use which for me is very comfortable and I can quickly take the headset off and it rests on my shoulders.  Sound quality is excellent.  I have not had any complaints on the other end either.Highly recommend this product for anyone needing versatility and walking around from the base unit.

Now this new battery I got to get a full week again after full charge, being unplugged for three hours after one five minute phone call if it was that, was in the red (battery dead).  Makes no sense charged it yesterday and haven't had any calls or made, and it still shows three bars (seventeen or so hours later)  contacted the company to let them know it dies quickly with just one call, they said they needed my phone number for more info (sent it).  Then checked the second email from them on the same day they were both sent, which said sorry, mass volume business, replacements already been sent. (don't know why they wanted my number, lol) they were on it so if this comes and works fine I'll say five for quality and five for customer service.  (note:sfplanets ipod replacement headphones for 1.99 have serious issues, both right sided, one side tinny, they couldn't send me a good pair twice, gave up for two bucks I'll ware a hat to keep in the rightees, and tiny one works just sounds funny on one side, anyway this is not them)  If it doesn't work or is the same as the one they sent, I'll give a two I guess just for the good quick customer service, and use my old battery at least it gets three good phone calls.  Remember got a cheap replacement phone just to get by is my only phone so it's needed and don't want to pay full retail for a new in factory plasic battery.  Plus I guess I've got the one phone call battery and the new one which well see what that is and despite inconvenience I may carry them as back up for certain scenarios, just to be able to make one last call so to say.  Hate doing that though, be nice if stuff just worked fine, first one ordered did.  Oh, I'm gonna talk to my dad and have him check his amazon records to find out who he bought it from and order one from them if this replacement doesn't work.

The sound quality is excellent with really impressive bass response.  Now I am pairing this with an LG VX8700 and perhaps that makes some difference.  There are some minor issues though.  Placing the phones properly on your head can mean that they are comfortable for a time, but eventually after about 2 hours they do seem to pinch. But even then it is not unbearable.  I have cycled with them, music stops when you answer and then resumes.  I have jogged with them, ear pieces pop off so you can rinse if necessary. Occasionally either the phone or the headset gets confused if you are trying to do something too fast.  Flipping through songs, and you have to re-pair the device.  Sound quality is pretty good through the microphone considering the distance.  Very slightly muffled, but still clear enough to not be a limiting factor.  A cool feature is that tap the right ear piece and it opens the music player on the phone and starts playing.  Jabra should consider putting a locking button at an appropriate location because it is easy to inadvertently push one of the many buttons when you are taking off or adjusting the phones.  Eventually you do learn how to handle to avoid this, but it is quirky.  I would so recommend this headset for those looking for something to pair with one of the newer phones that support a2d over bluetooth.  Excellent for cycling!Update 8/22/07  This headset continues to operate great, despite being dropped numerous times. As a side note, I found as I was riding today that the pairing between my lg vx 8700 was fouled as the music was intermittent.  While there is the occasional stumble in the otherwise smooth streaming, this was different.  I ended up removing the device from my 8700 and re-pairing it.  Fixed.  The only thing I can think of is that I had recently unplugged my phone while it was docked in usb mode to my pc and you are not supposed to do that without ending via the menu first.I use this headset to run with too and found a little floss can go along way.  Yep, I tied a bit of floss between the ear pieces leaving one side with a simple knot.  Then with the floss in position across the top of my head I pulled the ear pieces down until the plastic pieces which normally end up pinching the tops of the ears were just above the tops.  I then double knotted the simple knot again and voila, the floss helps support the headset while you are running and the pinching that I noted in my original review is reduced greatly.  I am actually sitting typing this listening to some Petty. Great stuff...","5.0","Excellent Sound Quality","1180396800","05 29, 2007"
"A174X7S1J75AZ3","B000E7YSWK","Jamie Hamel-Smith","[2, 2]","The battery life on these is phenomenal. I've been using these headphones with theJabra Bluetooth Music Adapterand the headphones outlast the adapter every time, and we're talking about 8+ hours of constant use.I'm also using this headset along with my PC and my RazrV3m. The phone does not support Stereo Bluetooth Audio (A2DP) but it does support the regular headset profile that most, if not all Bluetooth enabled phones have. This means that the headphones work as a regular wireless headset for any Bluetooth enabled phone or Skype on your PC / Mac.On the PC, the headphones provide the mic input, the mono headset feature and the stereo headset feature. This means that I can be watching a video or listening to music in beautiful stereo sound and if a call comes though on Skype, it'll switch over to the microphone & mono headset profile for the VOIP conversation. The same is true for using the music adapter mentioned above and a mobile phone. When a call comes in, the music pauses / mutes (depending on the device) and you can answer the call by tapping the left ear piece. Tapping the right ear piece will pause / mute the music at any time.Sound quality is actually very impressive. If you're using these with your PC and the sound is coming through mudddy and crackly, it means that you're not using the Stereo (higher audio quality as well) profile. It's quite possible to listen to music using the Mono (used for mobile phone conversations) profile, but you're missing the great sound if you do.A great thing about the sound quality is that the range is quite wide. I hear certain things in music with these headphones that my iPod and Zune headphones just wont reproduce. The headphones are not earbuds (or earplugs as I call them) so you can actually still hear someone if they speak to you, that is you won't be completely oblivious.They came with a wall charger as well as a USB cable so that's very nice. The manual says not to use any other cables to charge the headphones, but  close observation will reveal that it's just an ordinary USB-A to USB-Mini-B cable.

They have paired easily with every device I've tried, and even work very well as a hands free headset for a bluetooth cell phone. However, they don't work with my Mac, and contrary to the insinuation by the other reviewer, this is in no way Jabra's fault. Bluetooth is bluetooth, and it's up to the computer manufacturer to support the profiles supported by various devices. In the case of the Mac, Apple's Bluetooth support is incomplete; they don't handle the advanced audio profile required for stereo headsets, and so this headset (or ANY other stereo bluetooth headset, for that matter) will not work with a Mac until Apple decides to fix this. This is completely out of Jabra's control, and this is a very well engineered device. If you own a Window's XP computer, this will work very well.The only negative I can find is that the headset is not adjustable and thus may not fit everybody comfortably.

The buttons on each side are extremely easy to push and after wearing them for maybe 15-20 minutes it tends to make my left ear quite tender causing a readjustment or simple rest from it. I was really satisfied with my jabra bt500 and had faith that this one would deliver as well but in the end it was just ok. I also attempted the firmware download and it made not one difference it almost seemed as if it made it slightly worse. I'm thinking maybe it has something to do with the type of cell phone I have. It also seems at certain points during the song the music would come to a slow and then speed up during song, strange. It would really be helpful if people would list the type of c.phone they have so potential buyers would see and possibly keep looking if c.phones listed turn out to be incompatible. Overall it'll do for now considering the price but i will be on the market soon looking for an upgrade.","3.0","A slight disappointment...","1207526400","04 7, 2008"

Also, using these for phone calls is quite convenient. The microphone is great and sound quality is top-notch. Even when music is playing and you get a call it automatically pauses the music for the phone call and then resumes it when the call is finished. Battery life is way longer than I had expected; I have owned these for a couple of months now and have only had to charge them twice. Buttons on the headset are quite convenient as well.  I would say the only downside to these is that they are a tad bulky somewhat resembling earmuffs. Also, depending on your head size these may or may not fit on you; I can fortunately say that they fit me with no discomfort and stay on my head even when at the gym.

This phone is nice, dainty, and has a great display, but it ends there:*) The speaker isn't loud enough, so you're always pressing the phone to your ear so incredibly hard and still can't hear too well - I called T-Mobile, they acknowledged the problem and sent instructions to the phone to increase the speaker volume to no avail.*) The slider is hard to get to quickly - if you try sliding the phone open, many times you will actually reject a call.*) Using call waiting isn't too bad - when you go to call waiting it is easy, but retrieving a call is painful*) Text messages - this is the worst ever - first, slide the phone open, create a message, hit the enter key, then recent log, then select your recipients, then next then enter then the message sends.

In lieu of a decent, nonflip, bluetooth/camera phone w/ Tmobile I went with this phone. Friends and strangers alike say: ooh how pretty. I say ...Pros:1. 1.3 Mp camera2. Bluetooth3. most vivid clear screen I've seen on a cell4. good form factor5. opens & closes very well well (1st edition I had was a little clunky, had a Samsung China sticker on the inside, 2nd edition I had (replaced due to bad mic) doesn't have a manufacturer's tag)6. far better reception inside buildings than my previous SE T610 (w/ Tmo)7. camera has great & funny options such as cartoon bubbles and image overlays which all my friends think are hilarious thereby enhancing the blackmail potential or storytelling function of my phone's camera - good times! This little feature is silly, but makes me smile so much; if all features of the phone made me smile like this, I would have kept this phone.Cons:1. lack of customizability- no favorites/shortcuts- soft keys cannot be changed- cannot use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones (on 1st handset (which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem) I could, on 2nd handset, this functionality was gone! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them, whatevs Tmo!)2. lack of functionality- menu inaccessable during calls (cannot text or surf during calls)- no airplane mode- no notes function- poor Mac supprt- - does not work with Mac iSync (although, you can send numbers to phone from Mac Address Book (Menu: Card > Send card) via Bluetooth, which is at least some convenience, but not the convenience of iSync)- - my Mac OS 10.2.8 and OS 10.4.6 computers are unable to use dial up networking via Bluetooth or USB cable (despite the EDGE functionality and the claims of the sweet T-mobile techies who I don't believe)- - Bluetooth (via my Mac) only browses the memory card as far as I can tell, eg, sees pics only in the memory card3. GUI isn't well thought out - menu navigation difficult, sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done (sending a text to multiple people is a major chore), finding files is not intuitive, submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps (compare to the File menu on all Windows programs, it's the same because it makes thins easier, Samsung hasn't figured this little design STANDARD out)4. 1.3 Mp camera makes 17-40 kb sized pics ... WTF?!?5. problem with microSD card staying firmly inserted, aftermarket purchased card (necessary for music or multiple pics) pops outI will not buy a Samsung phone again. My phone MUST sync immediately and completely with whatever computer I have whether Mac, Windows, or Linux; currently the one I have is a Mac. Hello: Mac, Samsung, communitcate!! My previous phone, the SE T610, synched its contact list flawlessly to my Mac. The Samsung t809 database file type is currently incompatible with iSync. Don't believe claims on this or other websites saying the t809 sync's with Macs.Every single Samsung product (phones, home entertainment, etc) I have bought in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features. However, each was loaded with glitches. No more Samsung for me!Wish I had gotten a RAZR (free or nearly so with Tmo), held out for a Motorola Capri, or splurged and gotten a fabulous unlocked Nokia (every one I've had has been outstanding).UPDATE as of November 2006:The phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed. After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket, squatting down while painting and standing back up, the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn't apply to cracked screens. Tmo sent me a replacement, but I sent it back because they were going to charge another $150 for this irritation phone.","2.0","pretty, yes, but to me .... a waste of money","1153526400","07 22, 2006"

It's battery life is almost pathetic though.  It's reception is poor.  The big exposed screen is also prone to scratching, and getting dust/dirt under it.  You also can't use mp3's for ringtones without hacking/cheating it.  Rename mp3 to 3gp, copy to micro-sd, then copy back to phone memory.What really killed the deal for me was the reception though.  Had a Nokia 3650, awsome, even worked ok in my basement, next a Moto V330, barely worked upstairs, just bought 2 of these T809's and they won't even recieve good enough to let me setup my voice mail in my livingroom.

If you want a usable dependable phone look elsewhere.  This is like the RAZR's.  Form over function.

But, if you want a bluetooth headset to go along with it, get the Plantronics Voyager 510. I've tried the Motorola HS850 and H500 & a Logitech BT headset and all of them had significant static.  I've searched google and found other people have the same problem with this phone and multiple other types of headsets.  Go with the Plantronics Voyager 510.  It has very very little static and I can leave the phone in one room and walk to another with only a slight (almost negligable) increase in static.  The only problem is that the answer button on headset will answer the phone but I won't automatically connect to the headset.  I must first answer the phone by pushing the green button on the phone and then press the answer button on the headset. . .afterwards, connection is seamless.  A minor inconvenience for the luxury of wireless BT that is virtually static-free.  Don't take my word for it. Buy a Voyager 510 from a local store where you can easily return it if you're not happy.MP3 RINGTONES!!!!this phone is great for making MP3 ringtones.  HOWEVER, you most change the file extension from .mp3 to .3gp. Transfering .3gp files to your phone is a sinch with the free USB cable and PC software.  And, if you want to edit your mp3 so that you play only the chorus of the song as the ringtone, Samsung gives you software for that too!!!! It's all included in the PC Studio Software that comes with the phone.  DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE EXTENSION TO .3GP .  The phone will allow you to play any mp3 songs (like an IPOD) but it won't allow you to make MP3 songs as ringtones unless you pay for it by downloading from some website like T-mobile. . . OR, by the method mentioned above.  Changing the extension to 3gp is also easy if you have a program that will show you the FULL NAME of a music file (i.e. check_up_on_it.mp3), like Nero Burning ROM.","5.0","love this phone but watch out for the bluetooth headset","1144195200","04 5, 2006"

I have dropped it from my 2-ft high desk to the concrete floor once today and it got nothing damaged, not even a dent or mark.But there are couple of bad designs as well (or maybe I'm just too picky :-).1. No voice dialing function, which is the most needed function when make calls while driving;2. The camera is only 1.3 Megapixle resolution, so it's fine when viewing your photo just on the phone screen, but when you put it onto your computer, it turns into unacceptable;3. It does record videos, but only for couple of seconds, which means this function basically is useless in daily life;4. The most bad design is the earphone. It's so loose in my ears so when I turn my head a little bit, it will fall off. I had to pick it up when it fell or use a finger to hold it while I was driving and calling, and you know you have to keep on turning your head around when driving!5.

"A1ULPGDCSX8XUH","B000E93M4I","Jeantet Fields","[82, 82]","Motorola was floundering in the cell phone market until they came out with the RAZR.  Worldwide, it made a fashion and technological statement, which catapulted the manufacturer from a dismal afterthought to a leader in the cell phone market.  Then they released a candy bar equivalent (SLVR), and then improved on the RAZR's lines with the stylish clamshell PEBL.  This review is for the Motorola PEBL.After using the PEBL for a few days, the first thing that impressed me was the sound quality.  Recently, I have played with Sony/Ericson, PalmOne, Nokia and Samsung phones, and must say the Motorola sounds best.  First of all, the volume in the earpiece is loud enough for me to hear while walking on a busy New York city street, with cars, trucks and buses all creating a deafening noise.  Second, the volume control button is well placed to allow you to easily adjust the level.  Third, and best of all, the phone is intelligent enough to filter out much of the loud background noise, so that the person you're speaking with can hear you without struggling to make out what you're saying.  I have found that Nokia is good at this too, while Palm, Samsung and Sony/Ericson phones don't do this well at all, with Sony ironically at the back of the pack.  Also noteworthy is the speakerphone.  While it's not as loud as an office phone's speaker, it is plenty loud, for example,  to participate in a conference call while driving.  And with the background noise reduction virtues of this phone, I was impressed.  Also, it has voice recognition - based solely on the spelling of your contacts, the phone will recognize what you're saying and be able to voice-dial.It may seem odd to make such a fuss over sound quality in an age of smart phones, but as a designer recently explained to me: form should follow function.  So let the PEBL first and foremost be a good phone.  Then you can add the bells and whistles later.  Attention to this principle is what earned the PEBL five stars from me.A note about carriers: GSM is worldwide, so you can use your phone overseas as well as in the USA.  However, this limits you in the states to Tmobile and Cingular.  Having used both, I feel that Tmobile sounds better, but Cingular has better coverage.  It's a tradeoff.  Both carriers offer a 7 or 14 day trial period during which you can test the network's performance.  I recommend use that trial, and don't hesitate to bounce back and forth while keeping your number.I have four major pros for the PEBL:1. Motorola is pioneering the cell phone market by making all of their latest models quad-band GSM, which means the phone will work well in the USA (850/1900 Mhz) as well as the rest of the world (900/1800 Mhz).  Most GSM phones are Tri-Band (850/1800/1900) so while they'll work great here, but performance abroad will be touch and go, with the phone performing poorly indoors.  None of the others (Nokia, Ericson,  Samsung etc.) offer quad-band GSM as a standard, and until Motorola's recent offerings, you could only find Quad-Band phones in massive PDA smart phones.2. Battery life: All cell phones give estimates in standby time and talk time. But the realistic factor is how long will this thing last between charges for the average person?  My answer: 3 to 4 days.  With moderate use (about 10 calls a day, totaling between 30 and 45 minutes), I needed to charge the phone after the 3rd day.3. USB port: the phone's connection to the world is via a standard mini-USB port.  The charger fits this, or you can plug it into your computer with a standard USB to mini-USB cable.  This is the same cable that connects most digital cameras or certain mp3 players (at least the ones that don't use overpriced proprietary cables).  Chances are you already have one of these cables and if you plug it into your PC, two things will happen: the phone will start to charge from the USB, and the PC will detect a new device.  Download the drivers from Motorola (if you didn't get the CD with your phone).  In addition to phone drivers, there is a Phone Tools application that lets you to synchronize your contact list and calendar with Outlook, or you can simply backup the phone's contents.  You can synchronize your photos, ringtones and SMS messages as well.  Here's the best part: the phone is also a modem.  Make sure you have a data plan before connecting to the internet, and you no longer need a hot spot.  GPRS will give you a little more than 2x the speed of dialup, EDGE will take it up to about 4x.4. The phone has an alarm built in.  In fact it has several, and you can name them, and if you turn the phone off at night, the alarm will still work, and ask you if you want to turn the phone on when you silence it.Other noteworthy items: the screen is good, the camera produces reasonable images and videos, and there is enough memory to snap over 100 shots at the phone's highest resolution.  That is a nice touch.And now, three Cons:1. For the longest time, I have not cared much for the Motorola contact management interface.  Nearly all phones now allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but Motorola hasn't caught on yet.  If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times.  This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you'll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with Nokia or other phone brands.2. The phone allows you to assign custom ring tones for certain members of the address book; however, for contacts with a custom ringtone, the phone doesn't differentiate between calls and text messages, so if a contact with a custom tone sends a text, the phone might play an entire minute-long song rather than a quick beep beep, which can be annoying in the middle of the night.  Just avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments and you'll avoid that problem.3. The shiny dialing surface and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking icky.In conclusion, I was happily surprised with the PEBL.  It is a very sexy phone, and it sounds great.  It is the perfect phone for the audiophile, or for a person who wants a device that just works without having to cope with all the secondary bells and whistles phones have these days.  Historically, Motorola was known for producing good hardware - a virtue that is clearly stated with the PEBL.  If you intend to use all the fancy features of modern cell phones (SMS, MMS, etc) - in other words if you plan to use the software features, expect them to be less intuitive than with other brands of phones.  As much as Motorola is known for producing excellent hardware, their menus and navigation can be bewildering at times.  I think they should get the folks who designed the hardware to redesign the software interface.  Then, the Moto range would dominate.  In the end, it's a good phone, it's solid, it's small and light enough to fit in comfortablty your pocket, and above all it works.","5.0","Impressive","1159056000","09 24, 2006"

However, as other reviewers have cited, there are flaws:- The directional button is already missing paint in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is opened.  If I am seeing paint missing after only two weeks, I shudder to think what will happen after a few months.- The inside is definitely prone to getting dirty with fingerprints.- The magnets require you to keep the phone away from your credit cards as well as items such as your computer.- The first PEBL I received rang only intermittently.  Sometimes it would ring and others it woudnt do anything.  In these cases, I would only know that calls had been missed once the voice mail indicator showed.  The replacement phone I received now rings with every every call.- Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a sequence of six or so steps and therefore must be done before turning on your car if you are going to talk while driving.  No way can I connect the headset while paying attention to the road.  I have always used corded headsets prior to this and I find this to be annoying.- It took a few tries to get the hang of the voice commands.  I would say name dial and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found.  However, then I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command.  As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands work fine.- The phone opens when dropped.In summary, if you want a very cool looking, eye catching phone than the PEBL is for you.  However, if you are someone who does not care about the appearance of the phone, I would recommend looking at other models because all of the problems with the PEBL make it only about looks.","3.0","Very slick, but not the best phone.","1151020800","06 23, 2006"

Shaped like a river stone, it's attired in basic black & is nicely accessorized by a shiny metal hinge. I especially liked the oval shape, the rounded edges, and the rubbery textured feel of the casing is pretty nifty. It's very compact (3.4 x 1.9 x 0.8; 3.8 ounces), and it has weight when it's in your hand.As for features... The phone book holds 1,000 contacts, each of which can take six phone numbers, an e-mail address, a postal address, and a birth date. I like that you can place photos with contacts for caller ID that are viewed on the internal screen. Contacts can be assigned one of 12 polyphonic or MP3's. I also appreciate the camera, vibrate mode, a one-minute voice recorder, voice dialing, calculator, calendar, alarm clock, text & multimedia messaging, PC syncing (my favorite!!), instant messaging ( with Yahoo, AOL, and/or ICQ), and a Web browser.  You can personalize the PEBL with a variety of wallpapers, themes, menu styles, color skins, screensavers, and message tones. You can always download more depending on your service provider.Ok, now the bad.  The PEBL has a low-resolution camera (whaaa), and a strange magnetic flip that is awkward to open with your thumb.

I bought an unlocked Razr V3i straight from Motorola, to get the nifty purple color that's offered only on their website.  Bad, bad, bad idea.  About a month after I bought it, the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly, screen going dim, etc.  I mailed it in (the problem later turned out to be the SIM card), and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here!!  I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone, to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot, and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well, that was the first call.  After a week of no return call, I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times, with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back, and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However, the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions, and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.  There's nothing wrong with it, except that it's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range, and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time.  That said, you can't save more than ten or twelve text messages on it, and you can't back up your messages to your MacBookPro.I bought an Iphone a while ago.

"AXMVY1CH5125B","B000E95OAI","Dr. Sam Beckett Hoping for that last leap home","[52, 57]","After my dreadful V551, I was hesitant to return to Motorola. Since my Sony Ericsson S710a didn't work out, and since my wife's V3 has been solid so far, I decided to give Moto one more chance with the V3i.First, the build quality and materials are EXCELLENT. The machined aluminum outer casing, and machined nickel keypad, provide substantial heft (this is good) and tactility. Moto could've used a little better plastic in places, but it's fine otherwise.Second, although its resolution is lower than the S710a's, the V3i inner display's physical screen size is about the same. Meaning it's plenty large, not to mention clear, colorful, and bright. The outer display is nothing special, but it is a compromise for better battery life, so I can live with that.Third, unlike Sony Ericsson, the new Moto's (V3i, SLVR L7, etc.) sport an industry-standard mini-USB charging/data port, and use standard memory cards. (I put a 1GB TransFlash in mine and it is amazing.) No more proprietary chargers and cables, nor goofy Sony-only Memory Sticks.Fourth, the Bluetooth. Motorola has come a long way to improve their implementation, and though it is not as full featured as Sony Ericsson's, it is almost unshakable in its stability. (Sony Ericsson has the reverse trend. The T616 had great Bluetooth, the S710a's was unstable. The new W600 and W900 are equally unstable.) Range is excellent, too.Fifth, reception and call quality are both excellent. Volume could be better, but is still adequate. I have to admit, though, that the S710a was slightly better with earpiece and speakerphone audio volume and quality.Finally, the much maligned UI. Yes, Sony Ericsson trumps everyone with their interface and Address Book; Motorola executes both of these rather clumsily, thus requiring a steep learning curve. However, two areas where Moto outshines Sony Ericsson are 1) consistent UI responsiveness and 2) broad customizability.My only other gripe is the 50 song limit in iTunes, even with the memory card upgrade. However, I'm an iPod owner, so this doesn't concern me too much.Now for a word of warning to Mac users. My iTunes-equipped V3i, unlocked and unbranded, came from an overseas market (phone and manual languages included UK English, Vietnamese, Bhasat, and Thai). It has full Bluetooth functionality with my Mac, including iSync. However, some V3i's don't work over Bluetooth - the Mac can't see any of the phone's services, thus preventing file transfers or iSync-ability without a USB connection. I can't say for sure if this is related to iTunes or not, but so far it seems the iTunes-loaded V3i's work better. Caveat emptor!","4.0","Almost perfect, especially for a Mac user","1146182400","04 28, 2006"

That's three phones out of three - two for me and one for my daughter - with the same problem.  Lockups and intermittent operation.  I finally figured out part of the problem.  Whenever an attempted voice dial fails, whether it was an intentional dial or an accident of pressing the button by mistake or pressing the headset button too long, then the phone will not make or receive any calls until you power it off and on again.  At least now, if I am really careful how I handle it, my phone works most of the time.  My suggestion is not to buy this phone for another 6 months or a year!Original review follows:This is a great phone when it works.  There was a report this week on CNN about the RAZR phones that were sold late February 2006 and early March 2006 being recalled for a software bug.  It is my guess that the SLVR, which is a close relative of the RAZR, has the same bug because my SLVR only works about half the time.  Most of the time, when I try to make a call, the display will say Calling xxxxxxx but it just hangs there until I click End, even up to 20 minutes with nothing happening.Any time I don't use my bluetooth headset for a few hours and then try to use it, the bluetooth on the phone will have quit working and to get it working again, I have to power the phone off and on again.My daughter has the same phone and has the same problems.When it works, though, it is a great phone.  The iTunes holds only 100 songs, like the other reviews said, but that's an iTunes issue - it treats this like an iPod Nano.Cingular is sending me a replacement for my SLVR and, hopefully, it will work better and have these issues resolved.  In the mean time, I suggest giving more time for the bugs to be worked out.  Once it becomes more reliable, I would highly recommend the phone.","3.0","Great phone, when it works","1142553600","03 17, 2006"
"A1CYTBE7LLUQ8F","B000ELOPZ6","Living in Budapest livinginhungary","[5, 6]","I bought the SLVR for my wife and a RAZR for my self. People who want iTunes should buy their phones through a service provider who includes it on the phone. Our unlocked SLVR (apparently produced for use in Europe...it came with European plug and a US adapter)did not come with iTunes. Having read the reviews I expected this. My wife uses her phone primarily for talking and text messaging. The SLVR has worked well for this. The only issue is that some of the shortcuts don't work. The main one missing is the one which you use to lock your keypad so that buttons are not accidently pressed. We get this message saying shortcut not available on this phone. Other than this small annoyance my wife and I really like the phone. We're living in Hungary right now and the SLVR is not sold here, so it's extra cool for others to see.

"A3QHTL8Z1GMY93","B000ELOPZ6","Matthew Elvey tech whiz","[1, 2]","Some specifics about my experience, and usage tips; I'll leave it to others to do an overview:Out of the box, this is NOT a great phone.  It took a LOT of effort to learn and customize in order to use it effectively, but after that, it's very good.  If and only if you're up for the effort, I highly recommend the phone.  Older phones I've had were much more usable out of the box.MENUS:I changed the home screen buttons around to have the items I use the most - SMS, recent calls, and calendar, and to put phone book where I'm used to it being.  I also changed menu order.  Some moron put Tools under the Settings menu; that can't be fixed.  Since when is a Tool a kind of Setting?  Maybe it makes more sense in whatever language the developers speak.PHONE BOOK.I changed the phone book listing format - this was CRUCIAL to making it usable.  It has its own Setup menu, separate from Settings. These made it usable, especially View and View by:-- View by:list, Sort by:name, View:Primary Contacts, Search Method: Jump To.  I synchronize my phone book with my Mac iBook using the FREE iSync, for easy data entry and for backup.STORAGE:ESSENTIAL: I changed where it stores images, games, and ringtones (from the phone to the memory card), which allowed me to transfer images to my computer, transfer games to & from my computer (e.g. cellufun's free sudoku, chess, etc.), and use an mp3 as a ringtone.  This should be possible from the phone's internal memory, but it isn't, so WOW - knowing that this change makes is possible makes the phone MUCH BETTER than I thought it was at first.  Also, these settings (and some others too) get lost if the phone loses power and have to be reset; this is LAME!BLUETOOTH:It works well with the cardo scala-500 I got from amazon.  I set up a shortcut for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset. FYI, if you get a bluetooth headset, be warned that it can't be used to listen to music; in fact, if you have a bluetooth headset active, it refuses to play music through the built-in speaker.  [Edit: it does work with some (unspecified) bluetooth headsets, according to the manual; Update: BUT, I've tried 3 bluetooth headset models and they didn't work.  The SLVR doesn't support the required protocol, A2DP, so I think the statement in the manual is false.]iTunes:Very good!  I just wish it would remember what songs it had already played.  [Edit: maybe the repeat all option does that; it's undocumented; trying it now...]PRICE:I got mine for $50 with contract renewal from cingular ~Mar '06; a billing dispute took such a huge effort to resolve that the office of the president staff let me get it at that price.I've yet to figure out how to use the free EDGE I have grandfathered on my account to browse the Internet at no charge.

This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market. Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products. I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls. Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints. Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but nothing past 15 feet.3.

The callers on the other end said that the static was painful to their ears it was so bad.  I heard some static on my end which has never been the case with any headset phone pairing that I've had.  After one day, I boxed it back up and sent it back to Amazon.One thing to note.  This must be taken in the context of the phone it was paired with.  If you are not using the LG VX-9400, your experience will likely be different.  If at all possible, find a headset that others have already used with your phone and have reported success with.

I also like that you can easily switch it from right ear to left ear by just pulling the hook off.The buttons on this device are easy to access, and it was comfortable enough to use for extended periods of time.However, overtime, the static on the calls just got worse and worse until I could no longer use this without people getting really annoyed. I don't know if maybe I dropped it too many times, or if moisture got into it, but after working well for about a year and a half, I had to retire this device. I now use the H730:Motorola H730 (Bulk Packaged)Even at its best, people could still tell that I was using a bluetooth when speaking with this device. Since upgrading to the H730, I have not had a single person ask if I was using a bluetooth. I think the placement of the microphone hole on the newer version may have some impact on that, as it is away from your face more on the newer version, compared with being on the actual flip-open boom piece that rests on your cheek. For these reasons, I only gave this bluetooth 3 stars, and would recommend the H730 instead.","3.0","Was Good, But Static became too much...","1330387200","02 28, 2012"

I did however have a problem getting it to pair. I had to go online to figure it out since the directions that came with it were poor. I could not get the light to stop blinking blue and it has to be purple to pair. The online directions said to close the mic, hold down the button until it turns purple and then open the mic. That's not really correct either. You have to open the mic while your finger is holding the button down. They forgot to mention that important step. I can't tell you how many times I had to do it before figuring that one out. That said it works well and pairing was easy after getting the light to turn purple. Obviously with the 5 stars I gave it I'm recommending it.UPDATE: February 11, 2009 The Bluetooth has slowly died. People were no longer able to hear me. They said it sounded like I was miles away.

"A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","B000EM8REU","Gadgester No Time, No Money","[8, 14]","The MDA, designed and made by Taiwan's HTC, a leader in the Windows Mobile smart phone market (they seem to make all the WM phones sold in the U.S.), is really a cool concept.  It has a nice shape, a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape, and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile: Pocket Office, Pocket IE, MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player 10, and tons of free software to download from the web.  Plus, it has wi-fi which works really well.I really wanted to like the MDA, as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook (problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 Cobalt).  And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year, not two-year, contract (and still gives you a rebate).  Anyway, after a few days I was sorely disappointed.  The problem lay entirely with the MDA's reception.  It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003.  The MDA's antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable.  And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal.  It was frustrating to no end, even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception.  I never got half the speed promised by EDGE, the 2.5G GSM data network.  Very, very disappointing.  Much, much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.Summary: the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning.  It's a dud, thanks partly to HTC's poor antenna design and/or construction and partly to T-Mobile's poor EDGE and GPRS support.  If you can stand a two-year commitment, go with Sprint's PPC-6700, also made by HTC with the same sliding thumbboard design.  I haven't tried the PPC-6700 yet (cuz I'm pretty much broke now), but online reviews are mostly positive.","2.0","Really cool concept but marred by poor reception everywhere","1143763200","03 31, 2006"

"A3VEA7ACJUPTZ4","B000EM8REU","L. Russo","[10, 14]","I really, really wanted to like this phone.  I use a dialup POP account to access the web (from an old Treo 270) and bought this phone because it allows dialup IP connections where the Treo 650 doesn't.  I'd originally purchased a 650 and returned it because it prevents you from accessing the web via dialup (as soon as you put in the SIM card, it defaults to T-Mobile's GPRS network and locks out any other type of internet connection).Unfortunately, the PocketPC interface is absolutely unintuitive as compared to the Palm OS.  Where the Palm may require one or two clicks to access something or intitiate a task, the PocketPC requires you go through very cumbersome menus in order to achieve the same actions.  Learning these menus is a real pain.  Even such simple items as exiting a program or function can be frustrating because the commands needed to do so will change depending on the application you may be running (something as basic as a close box will move location from one program to another).  How do I get out of this?  one app has a close box in the upper right hand of the screen, another app. requires you to access a menu and then close.  When using the phone, turning on the speakerphone requires going through two menus where in the Palm OS it's thoughtfully placed right on your main phone screen.The slide out keyboard, although it looks cool- is very difficult to use.  Because the keys need to be flat in order to fit under the slide, they are not tactile enough to distinguish easily with your thumb, there is little resistance to activating them and it is very easy to press the wrong key unintentionally.  The stylus is laughably unusable as it's located on the bottom of the unit, is too small as well as being telescoping in a way where it's constantly collapsing as you try to use it.Where the Treo has a physical exterior switch to go into vibrate or quiet mode, the MDA/KJAM requires you to go through at least 2 onscreen menus to turn off the ringer.  I bought a 1 Gig memory card for the unit but can't seem to get it to save pix or video to the card.  I'm sure there's a way to do it, but again it requires learning more unintuitive steps & configurations from the manual.  When talking on the phone it's very easy to touch the screen with your ear or face so that functions and applications accidentally launch.  It's processor is relatively slow and there is almost always a 2 second lag between launching something and being able to access it.The WiFi does work very well and makes browsing a breeze. The screen is bright and clear.  Bluetooth is decent but sound quality suffers.  If your a techie who doesn't mind going through an extensive learning curve, the unit is as feature packed as you can get and more powerful than most other PDA/Phones on the market.  I also like the fact it uses a standard, non proprietary USB mini plug for synching and charging, making it possible to charge the unit with cables already on hand from other devices if necessary.It's not a bad phone, but needs a lot of improvements before being something practical to use on a daily basis.  After coming from the Palm OS, PocketPC is kind of like eating at Dominos after growing up on NYC Pizza.","3.0","Not bad, but not good.","1144281600","04 6, 2006"

I popped in the battery and was amazed she's still chugging along, and located my Wi-Fi connection without any hesitation. I had purchased the MDA solely for use of a custom-designed business application that worked under the Windows Mobile operating system. The company that wrote the app for me is long gone, but the MDA still works. The MDA's full-sized pull-out keyboard was amazing quality for the time, in an era when on-screen Blackberry keyboards were the standard.The only reason I'm not using this phone anymore is because I can't get a decent T-Mobile phone signal where I currently live and work.

I had just replaced an Audiovox PPC4100 PDA phone which was stolen with a new Motorola KRZR K1. I did not know whether this would efficiently replace the effective but cumbersome PDA I've had for so many years.After initially installing the MPT4 software it did an update but when I started the program it could not find my new KRZR K1. The software worked fine with my  wife's Razor V3. After a few tries I realized the program would update itself everytime I turned it on till it finally reached the latest version 4.1.2. After that it would sync the KRZR with my PC with no problem whatsoever!Although I've had to adjust to a number of things, one must also understand the program's limitations, the use of this software has definately exploited the KRZR's full potential. I've created different profiles on my laptop, store computer and home computer. and both my wife and I have no problems using it.

I was expecting this one to work well since it had a boom mic. But people still had a hard time hearing me. They don't have a hard time when I talk on my Samsung Epic Touch. So, this was a worse experience for my listeners. It doesn't have any noise cancellation, which might be part of the issue. It's a great headset for the price, but if you're a person who tends to mumble or be soft spoken, I would try another Plantronics headset. My trusty dusty is the Plantronics MX150. People can't tell a difference between that and the mic on my cell phone. I just keep buying them. I would love to find another since I have to keep buying the converters for the headset jack and that's been tough to find ones that work.As for comfort, I thought it would be better than some, but after wearing it for 30 minutes or so, I still get a little ear fatigue and need to take it off.

It's a very good basic phone that gives you good voice clarity and easy text messaging.

Had seen reviews that averaged 4.4 out of 5, so it seemed to be a decent choice. This turned out to be one of the best decisions made this year, as the BlackBerry turned out to be far better than expected... it was faster than my previous phone, reliable, versatile and rugged, and there were few dropped calls. But the phone had one simple problem: it's a battery eater!Went to my cell phone provider to see about getting an extra battery, and was surprised to find that the standard 1000 mAh OEM Lithium Ion battery cost was almost $45.00. That seemed a bit steep, so I began searching here on Amazon.com and found this Blackberry Li-Ion [OEM] C-S2 Battery. Was cautious because of the extreme price difference, but figured that if it was truly an OEM C-S2 battery, it was worth the gamble.Examined it when it arrived, and found that it not only had the original BlackBerry logo, but was marked C-S2 on the face, the correct version for my phone (and many other BlackBerry models). The back listed it as a Lithium Ion Battery, 3.7V, with a capacity of 1150mAh 4.3Wh... identical to my original battery. So it was charged overnight, as had done when the phone was first received with the original battery.It was good choice, as the battery has been a perfect backup to my original. It has function just the same as the original C-S2 battery, and there seems to be no difference. Went on to buy a second backup, just because it seemed to be a good idea for those better safe than sorry situations. Must admit that I do use the built-in GPS quite a bit, and that along with frequent 'Net access, probably accounts for my need of extra battery power. Might note that I picked up anExternal Battery Charger For Blackberry 8300 8320 8330, which has been the perfect compliment to these batteries.One might note that the prices on the BlackBerry C-S2 OEM batteries seem to vary quite a bit here, but most seem to come in well under $7.00... far less that what the cell phone retailers are charging.

It doesn't quite fit my giant head so well though.  It's a little tight on my ears, but not painful.  I imagine that it will loosen up over time.  The problem is that when the headphones sit idle, they bend in so that in order to fit them on your ears you have to flex them out, which creates quite a bit of tension.  The actual flexing plastic part seems fairly durable, so I'm not worried about breakage.The package comes with a mini-usb wall charger, a mini-usb to usb cable an extra set of foam ear pads, a bag for your headset and the headset itself of course.  So for $40, this is a fantastic deal for something that I imagine works just as well as the more expensive competitors and has a comparable comfort level.The weight of the device is not too much.

The problem, is after an hour of using them, I get a headache.  This is a real problem, since I have tried to open them a bit more, but the way the plastic band is done, it doesn't allow it.A minor drawback is the size, since they are very obvious on my ears (normal person), it makes wearing them a bit uncomfortable, and for sure rules out using them on the street, if you don't want to attract thieves that is.Aside from that, on my perspective the sound is good, the microphone works very well, the battery charge is good, volume and other buttons work properly.

These ones are much more comfortable for a longer time and don't seem so fragile.  I love how there's a built-in microphone for voice.  I've used this before with my phone and while people may give you strange looks while talking the person on the phone seemed to hear me just fine.I think these are also great to use when a cable often gets in the way.  I enjoy using these if I'm taking a bike ride.  I have an adapter for my ipod which I use with these. My only complaint is if I go to the gym with these on.  I can hear music fine if the volume is up, however if I'm watching a show on my iPod then often times I can't hear much of the dialogue.  So in those situations I end up using my ear buds.  I'd say the sound quality is alright.  I'm not an audiophile but I do usually have a good ear for sound quality.  The battery life on these seems good and I like how they can charge with a standard mini-usb connection.I've had 1 problem that's probably worth sharing.  Between pairing the headphones for different devices I sometimes had an issue and then it wouldn't pair to anything.  So I'd shut them off, plug them into a PC which is powered on.  After a few seconds I'd disconnect it and when I tried to pair them up again it would work.  I am not sure of the cause and didn't try plugging them into a regular power source to see if that fixes it.  So just a warning if any of you come across this problem too.

"A2ADAP9F4QCAXQ","B000FJ20CM","Glenn","[26, 32]","I should say I right now that I don't own a cell phone so I can't verify the microphone part of this thing - only the music part.  It's a bit funky to get used to, like learning all the colors and flashing LED's, beeps or the controls.  It's also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries.  I recommend you don't read the getting started guide, rather jump right into the user manual.You should get in the package:  1 BT620s headset, 1 USB to USB mini cord, 1 AC adapter, getting started guide, and user manual, spare pair of ear cushions, and finally a carrying bag.I was a little overwhelmed of the things it says it can do, so I thought it had about 10 buttons on each side.  Actually, both sides have 3 identical buttons (the big center button, and up and downs (left: volume, right: jump tracks or FF or RW).  The left big button is for phone control AND turning the power on and off and activating discovery mode.  The right big button just pauses, plays.The user guide explains the the length of holding the button down does different things.  For example: to turn it on, press the left button for a second.  To turn off, hold the same button for 5 seconds.  To turn on discovery mode - hold it for 5 seconds while OFF.  Cool beeping sounds tells you what is about to happen.It sounds great.  All the buttons that are applicable work (all but phone).  Good range.  The manual claims that the purpose for the usb to mini usb is so you can charge and wirey listen to music from your computer.  But it didn't work for me - it only allowed me to charge.  But you should be able to charge your headset where ever there is a powered USB port: PC's, PlayStation 2!  It's too uncomfortable having a thick usb wire hanging and and tied to my PC while listening to music anyway.The AC charger is cool because it's wider instead of longer then normal AC adapters so you can fit another plug below it.  There was absolutely no mention of the carrying bag ANYWHERE.  It still won't protect from the elements or drops or crushing it.  It's cool for reusing it as little things I guess.As for all behind the ear headphones, lying in bed is really uncomfortable, especially if your a side sleeper.And, unlike the logitech, NO signs of cracking on the band.Cons: I never want to see the flashing two blue LED's (steaming stereo).  It is possible to turn them off but they always seem to find a way back on; a little heavy; no user replaceable battery.EDIT: 5/8/11It's been sitting in a box for years, so I charged and paired it up.  I don't know whats happened to it, maybe the band got slightly bent but it's really uncomfortable behind the ears now.I gave it to a friend and he too wouldn't buy it for dirt cheap.  It's pretty heavy and bulky on the sides too.  I know this item is long discontinued but look FAR away from it.","4.0","I like it.","1148256000","05 22, 2006"

The Jabra BT620s allow you pair with two devices and I might add, the pairing process is simple.Battery life is excellent.The controls are a bit cumbersome to deal with, but with some practice it is simple to adjust the volume, answer a call, etc.One thing you must remember to do if you don't want to appear bizarre is turn off the blue light that continuously flashes around the lefthand ear piece. It is an annoyance to have to do this every time you turn them on.Sound quality is adequate and no more. I'm hardly an audiophile and don't demand much in the way of fidelity, which is a good thing with the BT620s, since its audio response is defeinitely lo-fi, not HiFi.I am constantly bothered by what sounds like static with my BT620s. When I make a call or dictate a note, my voice is recognizeable, but it does sound like I am talking through a pipe or something. Overall, sound quality with these is barely passable.The wraparound headband is not adjustable. Your tolerance for pain and discomfort on the other hand better be. There is a bit of an art to positioning these on your head. A millimeter this way or that means the difference beween mere discomfort and outright pain. After a while, you'll learn where your own sweet spot is with these, but I doubt you or I will ever find these things to be comfortable.Is the Jabra BT620 awful?

"A3DVPHGB4K1FIE","B000FJ20CM","P. Oh","[2, 3]","I came across David Pogue's review of Bluetooth headphones in the New York Times and researched the three sets he mentioned. Compared to the other's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime. I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house. The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile' to operate with the Jabra as a music player. Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i couldn't use the headsets for music was disappointing. As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design. After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC. However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers wouldn't work on either application. The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer. On the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price), comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren't audiophiles. The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up (15 feet seems to be the max)and on a minor note the flashing LED's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device. Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but. What started out as a promising technology- connect all your devices wirelessly - became the usual gobbledygook of support calls and technospeak and incompatible standards that left one frustrated at the technology. I sent mine back to Amazon for a refund and will stick with wires for a while longer.","2.0","Not ready for Prime Time","1194134400","11 4, 2007"

They charge fast and work great. Only problem I ever have is without a case, you can accidently turn them on way to easy and when you need them, the battery is dead. The on button is on the right ear and pushes very easy to turn on the unit expecially when you handle them to just move them.  You have to always be sure that the light is not blinking or you'll drain the battery, whose charging connector comes with a standard small USB connector found on most phones and headsets today.

Some sounded tinney, and all carried lots of road noise.  So the people on the other end always complained.In stepped in the BlueAnt Bluetooth which I read about as Gadget of the Week in Barons.  The device works very well. I simply leave it on the magnetic holder provided which rests on the Visor. I can hear the caller very clearly.  The device is especially good at boosting the volume level.  So I can turn the volume up and hear even the softest voices while traveling on the highway.  On the other side of the call, the callers tell me that the voice quality is pretty good, with a hint of echo sometimes.  Most important, they don't complain about road noise.I leave the device in the car all the time, and recharge it about once a week.  The on-off switch is great.  You flip the microphone down toward you and it is ON.  You flip it back flat into the device, and it is off.  So there's never a mystery about whether it is ON or OFF.I highly recommend this device for anyone who uses the cell phone while driving.  Keep in mind that this device is essentially a speakerphone in the car.  So everyone in the car will be able to hear the conversation, and everyone in the car is able to speak to the person on the other end of the call.

Now I have: 200+ songs with very nice audio (even the speakerphone), good quality snapshot pics (daytime), Full web browser (Opera Mini), RSS Reader, eMSN Messenger, email, 40+ games, Google maps (for directions), currency converter, all the stuff that the phone came with originally and I still have a little less than 3 GB left (videos coming soon).  Oh, and it's a phone too.  A very good one at that.  No dropped calls so far (005 update with Cingular service- Miami) and good battery life, especially when you consider that I have been using it quite heavily for the past week.  Feels solid too. Everything else has already been said.Gripes- The volume in the earpiece is a tad low (but much better than my old Moto V551), and I haven't figured out how to hear my ringtone while I have the earbuds on (while I listen to music, the music simply stops when I get a call). And about the earbuds- I like them a lot. Yes, it does kind of suck that you have to use the adapter (especially when you want to charge at the same time), but I don't see why they would not be portable since the buds and adapter are about the same length and size as a normal pair of earbuds.Overall, best phone I have ever owned.","5.0","Solid Performer","1158278400","09 15, 2006"

That great SE interface, made even better and now lacking the infamous sluggishness of past phones. And as always, one of the best Bluetooth implementations available.And yet... My first phone died within 12 hours of using it; first power-cycle resulted in a flashing white screen. The replacement phone from SE's service center was shipped in a partially disassembled state. The replacement for *that* phone was fine for two months, but now has a FastPort that's going bad (wired stereo headsets - and I've tried a few - don't work properly any more). This phone will be going back as well, but what am I going to get in exchange now?I give the phone itself 4 stars, (my increasing concerns over its) build quality 3 stars, and SE's lousy service and support 2 stars.

"A18MBO1U4DPY20","B000FSJYQ8","Harkanwar Anand","[141, 149]","My previous phone was a Nokia 6600. It had a slow interface for 2006 and come on, I wanted to try somethingn new.Initially, I had planned on exploring my chances of buying a Treo but due to the rates, I gave up my plan. Without much pondering, I went and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i. Now, it's been four weeks. Let me just give you a brief run thru of features, pros and cons.Features1. This phone is an mp3 player. This phone is a torch/semi flash light(with an SOS signal that can be configured). This phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera. Overall, it saves a lot of space to use this phone instead of just going out with a standalone mp3 player or/and a digital camera2. The interface is fast. It takes around 8 seconds to get an auto focus and click a picture using the camera. I'll try and explain - to come out of the screensaver you need half a second, to activate camera using the shortcut it takes 3 seconds, a further 2 seconds for auto focus and an additional 1 second to click you picture. Overall,8 seconds to click one image.You can browse thru pictures very quickly. It's around 7 times faster than my Nokia. Images can be clicked in sepia, black and white, solarise(kinda yellowey), negative and normal modes. Brightness can be reduced within the click of a button. I noticed grains on images of larger size. I don't recommend using the flash camera unless you really must. Plus while clicking a video, the light goes on and off, if the flash light is turned on.3. The build quality on the phone is both good and bad. I love the keypad and it is a major improvement from the 800i and sundry walkman phones. It took me three days to get used to the keypad. The dictionary like function on the phone keeps a track of all the words you spell. So they're definitely there the next time around. The front of the phone seems to appear too plastic. Especially the silver scroll keys and sometimes can make your phone look like a dummy piece. The sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone and can be used conveniently even when the phone is upside down. You can insert your memory stick pro cards even when the phone is switched on. There is NO CAMERA SHUTTER like the previous installment of this phone (800i) The power button is placed most effectively just like the volume buttons on the right side of the phone which can be used for a host number of features.4. The internal memory of this phone is 22mb and the accompanied card contains 512mb worth of memory. The usable memory,however, is only 431mb. Upon connecting to the pc, both are instantly recognized and act as removable drives on the my computer icon. The accompanied software is almost brilliant. I loved Disc2phone and there is so much more I keep discovering about the other programs. Despite lacking an English Manual, I found I didnt need one because I don't know too many people who would buy a sony ericsson phone and not be techies in their own rights who like to configure things on their own.5. The bundled earphones are sublime. I cannot beleive the sound on these. They cancel all the noises in a room and it's a pleasure listening to beethoven playing away or Enya's mesmerising voice or even Tool's prog metal for that matter. The speakers are satisfactory and could have been louder. If used as a stand alone mp3 player with earphones, the phone would stand for around 6-7 hours.Playing the music without using earphones can eat up battery depending on the volumes of course. It supports m4a, mp3 and aac formats(and a few other formats)6. The messages memory of the phone is limited to around 150+ messages and that is a big blunder. Despite having a 512mb of external storage the phone cannot accommodate a mere 200 messages. The size of notes is limited and you need to make a second note to carry on. Bluetooth transfers to Samsung,Nokia phones runs at 20kbps while it's a consistent 40kbps for Sony Ericsson phones. Very good for transferring media.Pros- It can be called an ipod replacement. I don't use mine quarter as much as I used to. This is owing to the absolutely brilliant earphones that sit within your ear and help you celebrate your time.- I love how the phone slides into a digital camera. Good build quality for the particular feature.- Good standby, saves battery, easy to work with 50% brightness. Even when I reduce brightness from 100% to 50% (lowest possible) there is hardly any noticeable difference on the screen. The keypad is much lighter but that's hardly noticeable.- Fast processor, super graphics and wallpaper options, includes a good browser, calendar, good default themes- The accompanied torch can be used to change a flat tire and can be switched on for 25mins even when the remaining battery is only 15%. (tried and tested)- Good keypad(KEY FEATURE), good playlist configuring options- Excellent software for the phone, mp3s can transferred at variable bit-rates without taking too long- Excellent,fast log, the phones keeps track off the last ten numbers you've messaged and keeps them around for easy usage- It's easy to store numbers cause the phone prompts to save numbers when a call from an unknown number ends- Great handsfree- There is a memory stick converter (The longer ones used in cameras) and that is a handy thing- The MACRO mode helps in copying handwritten/type written documents using the cameraCons- too plastic, looks a bit boring too soon, screen can be scratched if no touchscreen is present- the accompanied tones for messages is sad, the message memory is very limite (Big DEMERIT) and the size of a note is limited- Call quality is not as good as can be- sometimes it takes over a minute for the phone to recognize it has been plugged into a USB slot- the accompanied FM radio needs to be in place to avoid screechiness in sound and proper volume- Even though the phone provides 512mb worth of external memory, only 431mb is useable. Ideally, i'd have liked a one gig card so I could have doubled on my usage.- Not enough upgradations over the W800i. People can settle for that phone because it has a slightly better talk life- IT HAS NO ENGLISH MANUAL- noticeable grains on 2megapixel imagesConclusion,All though I am very happy with this phone, I cant help but throw a fit over the limited message storage, you can save messages onto your pc but come on, who's gonna do that?Buy this phone if you like what you read. Not enough reasons to upgrade for 800i owners. BUT this phone has more appeal than 800i and has better more smooth graphics. There is a much better display and there is an improvement of 25% which I just noticed.However, unlike the 550i , there are no three way speakers and that makes Stereo Widening impossible.Overall rating - 7/10Very little to complain about,reallyGood luck,fellow techies","4.0","My First Sony Ericsson, A review from a Nokia Fanboy","1152316800","07 8, 2006"

I will assume that plastic was chosen to ensure the light weight, however, I think aluminum is the way to go and is much more sturdy.  For example the RAZR.- battery life is something of a challenge.  even the extended battery will only give you about 12-14 hours with moderate use.Other than what I listed above, the phone is great and I am still fairly happy with the phone.TIP - Try to find any defects with your phone within the first 15 days.

"A10U3Z35FCPXF2","B000FYU4SO","Dennis bozhed","[681, 715]","I have read a lot of the reviews and spoken to a number of current owners of the Motorola Q. I have also owned and used Blackberries, Treo's, LG Phones including the LG VX9800 and the Motorola Razor. I picked one up this week and here are my initial impressions.The phone layout and design are excellent. Compared to other devices like the Blackberry and Treo, the keys are in a much better location (about  up from the bottom end of the phone) making it much less stressful on the thumbs to type. The keys functions are very similar to a Blackberry. Takes a little bit of getting use to but learn very quickly.Active Sync, which it comes with, is a breeze to set-up and start syncing. Works great with Outlook. I also have set-up my device to pull down emails from my gmail account. I read one review that said everything was being doubled when transferring. No so here. Works like a charm and very fast. Internet connections are much faster that on my Blackberry, which my work has supplied me.The battery is another item that people tend to give bad reviews on. That may be why Verizon is currently offering a 60 dollar battery for 19 dollars. Supposedly the extended battery will give double the time which as I understand it from other users is about 2 days.One of the big issues that people are focusing on in these reviews is the processing speed and how it is affected by having multiple applications open and the hassle of closing them once you are done with them. First, the Motorola is like any computer....having multiple applications open and running all at once will kill the processing speed of computer. Second, to close the programs is much easier than represented in these reviews. Just go to your home page and click on the top smart icons Task Manager and Kill All tasks running.So far very happy with my decision.Update: 6/12/06After a week of using my Q, I am still pleased with my decision.  I continue to monitor the other reviews and what I find interesting is the fact that many people focus on items that are very nit picky, i.e. the screen is slightly off center.  Interesting...I didn't even notice until that person pointed it out.  What is also interesting is that people tend to want a device that does everything exceptionally well (pda, phone, etc).  I would agree that that would be the ideal but I am happy with a device that does everything good.  Each person has their own preferences and what you really need to keep in mind is what you need the device to do.  I just need a device that syncs with my home computer (outlook), can send text and picture messages, syncs with my email via the web and provides me occasional access to the internet.  The Q does all that and more.Update 6/16/06Ok.  I have returned my phone(s) yes, plural!!  Let me explain why.The first phone had an issue with it's bluetooth functionality/transmitter.  I returned it and exchanged for another Motorola Q.My second phone I had for one day before it completely died and nothing I or tech support could do would allow it to be restarted.Motorola has some serious issues to overcome with their Quality Assurance program.When I was on the phone with Verizon Tech Support I asked them which device/Smartphone they recieved the least number of calls on...they said the Treo 700w.  As such, I return my Motorola Q and purchased the 700w.  Wow, what a difference!  The Treo is much faster and much easier to use.  I would downgrade my rating but unfortunately once the stars are choosen in Amazon's rating system they cannot be changed.","5.0","Excellent Smartphone - Scratch that....bad  Smartphone","1149811200","06 9, 2006"
"A97R2RMCBRVTY","B000FYU4SO","DrZ","[14, 24]","I want to warn IT professionals that Verizon Wireless phone data email service is inappropriately spoofing sender's email address in messages sent from Motorola Q. This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives, the Verizon system is spoofing the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server. These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.When we wanted to try to white list (unblock) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server, their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent. This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I don't blame them for this. I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.Instead of spoofing a desired email address, messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct From and Reply-to addresses, with the first being any external Verizon wireless address, and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.Although Q seems like a good device, we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both From and Reply-to fields configurable. Small shops with Microsoft Exchange and loose anti-spam settings probably won't have problems like this.","1.0","Verizon service is spoofing sender's email address when configured for IMAP","1152662400","07 12, 2006"
"A2J6407B4TJFOW","B000FYU4SO","Mike Frerkes Mike","[18, 18]","Having previously owned the LG VX9800 (one of the best phones EVER made) for nearly a year, I was hesitant at first to switch over to a PDA/Smartphone format...but I'm glad I finally did.  The Motorola Q is a must-have for anyone who needs both Internet access and PDA productivity features wherever they go.  Most PDA phones are bulky and quite clumsy for the task of conversing without the aid of a headset.  This phone, however, is short and slim enough to make that problem negligible.  It fits in an ordinary shirt or pants pocket with plenty of room to spare.  The speakerphone is of good quality, so if you don't have a headset and don't like pressing a PDA to your face, phone conversations still come through very clear.  Windows Mobile 5.0 has many useful features, but accessing them can be somewhat tedious work at times.  The keys are very tiny and I was disappointed that the Q doesn't have dedicated number keys, unlike the VX9800.  Also, the plastic cover on the mini-SD slot is hard to remove and practically requires a pair of small tweezers just to open.  Those are my main gripes about the phone, but overall the positives outnumber the negatives.  The camera takes decent pictures and the side scroll wheel comes in very handy for navigating around the screen.  Speaking of the screen, its very bright and crisp...though using it in direct sunlight may prove a little challenging.  As I stated at the beginning, the Internet features are oustanding.  I have Verizon's unlimited data plan and despite the fact EVDO is not yet available where I live, I can still stream radio stations flawlessly over the built-in Windows Media Player.  In fact, the Q multi-tasks like a champion: One time I was listening to a streaming audio feed, surfing the Internet, and sending a text message all at the same time without a trace of hesitation from the CPU.  Non-Internet applications like Pocket Streets and Trips also run smoothly.  With a gadget like the Q, laptops are suddenly looking more and more like desktops.","4.0","Ultra small and powerful...but not 100% quirk-free","1156809600","08 29, 2006"

It's probably in the manual but in this day & age I shouldn't have to read the manual to figure out how to use my phone.4.  There are no games that come with it.

Bluetooth is great, and the Samsung PC Suite (free download from Samsung) lets you edit your contacts, upload ringtones, and just about anything else you want to do.  Battery life is great, about one week between charges.  The speaker is not the greatest quality, so a headset is recommended.  Cingular did not bundle a headset, so that's extra.  Interface is intuitive and functions are easy to figure out.  Speakerphone sound quality is only marginal.The main selling point of the phone is its sliding and its thinness.

"AHNHLGKIZ2N3B","B000G2TLIO","D. R. Jeanclerc Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","[406, 410]","The LG VX8300 is the latest offering in the market for do-(almost)-it-all cell phones.  It combines all of the standard phone functionality with music and video playback and phone, making it a media powerhouse considering that it's such a portable, affordable package.  The next step up would be a smartphone, but at significant extra cost for the addition of more well-rounded PDA functions.THE PHONEThe first thing you'll notice about the 8300 is that it's a great-looking piece of tech - stylish and modern yet also subdued enough that it won't embarrass you in business settings.  Some pictures make it look black, but it is actually a deep metallic pewter color.  It's roughly the same size (3.5 x 1.9 x 0.9) as LG's other recent clamshell phones, although a little slimmer for easier pocketing.  It feels solid but not heavy at 3.9 oz with the standard battery.  The plastic case feels softer than prior models, so it may be more susceptible to scratches and scrapes over time.  There is a leather case for it, but I doubt you could bear the idea of covering up this good-looking unit.The 8300 runs on Verizon's CDMA all-digital network, so coverage may be an issue if you live in rural areas.  I've been a Verizon customer for years with LG digitals and never run into any dead spots around town and while traveling, but check Verizon's coverage maps on their website beforehand.Voice clarity is superb, both for you and for the person you're calling.  The 8300 has speakerphone capability, but amplified through the external audio speakers, it tends to be so loud that it may distort - set your volume appropriately low.The phone has a wide array of conveniences, including numerous handy voice-activated commands (send messages, check voice mail, look up contact, examine wireless account, etc.), one-touch calling, unique rings and photo IDs for different contacts, an address book with room for 500 contacts, and so on.  I'm a huge proponent of the voice-activated commands, and while the 8300 is very easy to set up, the long-term downside is that instead of matching up your command with your own prerecorded voice as prior models did, this phone tries to actually phonetically read entries from your contacts list and find a match that way.  So, if you have unusually-spelled names with silent letters in your contacts list, the 8300 will have a tough time making a match.  Plus, when it repeats the name back to you, it generally mangles the pronunciation, making that form of caller ID undesirable.  It's too bad that the contacts list doesn't have a separate nickname field so that you could accurately store the contact as say, Mike Krzyzewski but have the voice-activated commands look the entry up as Coach, for example.If you're obsessive about ringtones, then you'll be disappointed with the default offerings.  They play back with great quality, but they're pretty boring.  Verizon clearly wants you to go to their GetItNow service to purchase the latest and flashiest ringtones.  It's not documented in the manual, but it is possible to use MP3s loaded into the phone as ringtones.The phone supports Bluetooth v.1.1, which makes it easily compatible with many wireless devices like headsets/earpieces.  You can also use this to wirelessly transmit and receive contact information with other Bluetooth devices.THE CAMERAI bought my first digital camera about five years ago - a 1.3 megapixel Olympus for about $350.  Now, for a fraction of the price and space, the 8300 delivers that same picture quality.  It's also got additional features that make the results actually worth viewing/printing, including flash, white balancing for a variety of lighting conditions (no more washed out or oddly-tinted phone pics), a four-position digital zoom, and night mode.  There are also some capabilities for having fun with your photos such as special effects (negative, posterize, etc.), self-portrait capability using the external screen as a viewfinder, and a timer.  You can take pictures from 160x120 thumbnails all the way up to print-quality 1280x960.The camera can also take videos, although the quality is predictably choppy and the largest clip that can be sent via email is only 15 seconds.  Like any of the phone's media, larger clips can be stored to the phone's internal memory or onto an optional microSD card and then copied to another device or PC.Photos taken can be used as contact IDs or wallpaper on either the external or main screen.  Both screens are breathtaking in their brightness, clarity and resolution.  They never fail to register the initial jaw-dropping compliment when someone sees the phone for the first time.MUSIC PLAYERYou can't really say MP3 player because the 8300 wants to only play files in Microsoft's .wma format.  This is because Verizon wants you to use their VCast online music store.  I purchased the Music Essential Pack with my phone and was sorely disappointed in this - the VCast software wouldn't load (it kept trying to roll me back to Windows Media Player 10 even though I'm on 11), the USB cable kept losing connection (crummy driver software), and the headphones were just so-so.  I recommend instead investing in a big MicroSD card and using it to store and transfer all of your music, photos and videos.  This is clearly the easiest way to load information back and forth between the phone, although Verizon won't tell you that since it cuts their overpriced music store out of the loop.  And if you do prefer MP3s for playback, the 8300 may not be configured out of the box to play them, but it's a simple change to make - just search the web for instructions.The sound for playback is very good, again considering that it's not a dedicated music device.  The external stereo speakers are on either side of the clamshell hinge and they pump out a lot of sound for their size.  The 8300 has a very good ergonomic feature in the form of player control buttons (play/pause, fast forward, rewind) on the outside face of the phone.  So, you can keep it in the palm of your hand rather than flipped open while listening.BUSINESS/PRODUCTIVITYThe 8300 comes with the standard roster of business apps dumbed down for cell phone usage:  calendar, world clock, calculator with tip macros, etc.  At this time, I haven't found an easy way to sync data back and forth with any desktop apps like Outlook or Notes.  There are open source apps on the Web like Bitpim that can do this, but the 8300 is currently too new for that software to handle.  That gap should be remedied soon.Verizon offers wireless broadband via an EV-DO network that includes most major metropolitan areas and airports.One exceptional add-on that Verizon offers is VZ Navigator, which turns the 8300 into a GPS-driven navigation device.  You can purchase the add-on either monthly if you do a lot of traveling by car or even day-to-day if you're just taking a short trip.  It works well, looks great, and really boosts the usefulness of this unit.CONCLUSIONThe LG VX8300 combines a great phone, a camera that's actually useful and some pretty cool media capabilities into one compact unit.  There are of course some trade-offs for each, but the convenience of only having to carry one slim item in your pocket is invaluable.  It really is a marvel for the price.PROS* A very clear phone with many convenient features like voice-activated commands.* A 1.3 megapixel camera capable of taking pictures you'd actually have printed thanks to 1280x960 resolution, flash, and color effects.* A good-sounding music player that, when combined with your own library on an optional microSD card, puts hours of entertainment in your pocket.* Bluetooth capability for wireless add-ons and communication with other devices.CONS* Incompatible with existing accessories - get ready to buy new chargers, sync cables, etc.* VCast music store is overpriced and not easy to set up (just get a microSD card and use it to store/transfer media instead - no problem).* Initial selection of ringtones is pretty dull - another attempt by Verizon to squeeze extra charges out of you.* Some of the external buttons are awkwardly sized and/or placed - people with larger hands may cramp up after prolonged periods of use.","4.0","Sleek Looking Phone with Lots of Nice Functionality","1150156800","06 13, 2006"

Only today, it's hooked up to my Bluetooth in the car, and it stays in its little cubbyhole and doesn't see the light of day except for its weekly charge. It's really too much trouble to take it off Bluetooth, so we do all our calling from the car, and even that's not much. Our kids all all back in this state and within an hour of us, and chatting doesn't seem to be anyone's style nowadays. It's not a smart phone, but we're smart people: we now prepay for a year and, although we ended up with 120 hours per phone (my wife has the same one), we're also running $500 less than when we paid monthly. And Verizon has even gotten better. I haven't found a dead spot in this mountainous area except for Sequoia National Park where I didn't want to talk to anyone anyway.Still think it's a great phone, And if you absolutely MUST, you can get on the internet and you can take a snapshot. Unfortunately, that will cost you extra.****I have owned cell phones since the time of the Brick, and 10 models in between. Now that coverage is excellent in most of the country (mountains are still a problem in this neck of the woods), if you want a phone to make phone calls, this is probably a little better than most. It is certainly more durable than the Razr.The pluses: Good reception for the most part; great speaker phone (better than my wired office phones); good display.The minuses: The handbook that comes with it is 37 pages long. Anything after page 4 costs money. Send out five high res pictures, and you run into real money. And it may be an MP3 player of sorts, but at $2 a song, I'll stick with my iRiver or iPod.The long and short of it. After looking for a year for a phone that just made phone calls, this is what we chose. I don't need the camera, but now you have no choice. With special incentives from Verizon - probably because we've been with them for 3 years - the total cost was the retail tax for two phones. Everything else was a mail in or instant rebate.Four stars because it's a fairly good phone, and I've given up on persuading anyone under 50 that they still need a wired phone especially when you want to talk to more than one person at a time. Yeah, the speaker phone is great, but so sensitive that it'll pick up ambient noise so that I can hear people who are 15 feet away from it.","4.0","Good Phone If You Just Want to Make Calls","1171929600","02 20, 2007"

Next, they charged me $15 because I ported my old number, in past I received this service free with T-Mobile and Cingular.Customer service is not friendly at all.Amazon Experience:The sad part of my story starts when I received this phone.I opened the box and it looked like used phone, with dust inside plastic protector and edges coming off and scratches where Mini-SD card goes. I thought its not a big deal so I called Verizon, they came up with resolution after couple calls and hold time that goto store for a free replacement. I went to store, the lady kept trying but nothing happened then a answer that oh may be because you bought phone from Amazon and their customer service should take of this.Ha, who don't know on this earth that Amazon don't care for customer satisfaction at all. There is no one who can help you. After few emails I lost hopes and now stuck with this phone.Now I think I shouldn't have bought it from here, if it was thru Verizon at least I can get new phone.My 2 cents don't buy from here, its worth buying from Verizon directly in long term.","1.0","Never buy this phone, Never buy from Amazon","1175817600","04 6, 2007"

"AGVB3UZIPFHEF","B000G7LWRM","Sheldon","[3, 6]","I just upgraded to this Motorola Razr.  Like most of you, when this came out I really, really wanted one, but they were just too pricey. Now the price is within reason, so I went for it and extended my plan.I'm not sure what all the complaints are about. The phone is very thin and once in your pocket you hardly know it's there, and the lack of an external antenna makes it much easier to get out of your pocket. It has a nice feel to it and is wide enough so it doesn't feel like a toy.  I have very small hands and have little trouble working everything with one hand. The flat buttons don't bother me, but I wish the OK button in the middle of the toggle ring was raised up just a bit.  I find myself using my thumbnail to press it.I'm having no trouble with hearing people, and the ringers are just loud enough for me.  The complaint about several button being located on the flip up cover are not a real problem.  If they were on the lower part of the phone you would be pressing them all the time.Yes, the screen is difficult to see in bright daylight, but aren't they all, including most cameras and PDA's.The voice activation feature worked right away, after installing some contacts, and made few mistakes.I also got the GPS Maps feature and the Web option.  I have not had a chance to really test the GPS, but it did locate my position within a house or two.  The Web option seems to work very well and I was able to get lots of info quite easily and rather quickly.I did spend some time with Verizon on the phone to learn how to activate these features and learn how to use them, but I've always found Verizon service to be excellent, and the person stayed with me until I had all the features down.I was told that the Razr has gone through some software changes and unlike the stories I've heard, the top does not feel like it's going to fly off the phone across the room. It feels really solid considering how thin it is.I would say if you've been waiting now is the time. It looks like they've gotten some of the bugs out of the phone, and while it does take awhile to get over the learning curve, for any advance features, I really like this phone a lot.Is it perfect?  Not at all, but it is extremely popular, and it's been around long enough so you can find just about anything for this phone on the Net.I would have given it 5 stars, but it's just confusing enough learning how to use it I had to give it 4.Also, like others have said:  If you want a decent camera get a decent camera.  If you want a decent PDA get a decent PDA.  If you want an iPod get an iPod. This is a very good phone with lots of extra features, but it's not perfect.  Personally, I don't think the perfect phone exists -- yet.","4.0","Not sure what the complaints are about","1178409600","05 6, 2007"

I don't like carrying a wireless on a belt clip so love to slip this baby in my shirt pocket--Nice, easy-to-read screen. I wouldn't want to watch TV on it, but that isn't why I buy a wireless phone.--VZ Navigator. This was what inspired me to switch from Cingular. It is a fantastic feature. I've tested it about ten times and it has been spot on, with accurate on-screen prompts, voice instructions, and estimated time of arrival. It turns me right into the driveway I need.  If you miss a turn, it recalculates new instructions in a matter of seconds.  The only down side is that it works from the quickest route and has no way for you to override that.  For instance, I went to friend's house and it had me get on a toll road for a few miles.  This WAS the shortest route, but not one I would normally have taken.--Voice recognition system works great. It doesn't have to be taught and can access all items in the contact list, prepare a blank text message, or dial a dictated number--Clearest calls I've had in a wireless phone.  You sometimes hear the people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a wireless.  That's been my experience with this handset.Cons--Strength of reception not quite as good as a handset with an external antenna, even a stubby one.--I wish they hadn't taken away the vibrate+ring option.  The Razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring.  I also wish there was some sort of external LED to indicate when I missed a call or have voice mail.  As is, you have to open the Razr to check this.  An NEC handset I had a few years ago had very nice system with different color LEDs.--Verizon's proprietary menu system is more difficult to use than the organic Motorola one and takes away some customization options such as setting hot keys. I also haven't found a way to turn off unnecessary prompts (Do you really want to delete this missed call?).  There is also no way (at least that I have found) to change the red band at the top and bottom of the screen. It only looks decent with some sort of red wallpaper.--Verizon has the phone locked down so it's difficult or impossible to add pictures and ringtones without paying them.--It's plastic (the Amazon review is just plain wrong on this point). I wish there was still the option of buying a metal Razr like the first generation ones. I would have paid extra for it.  Like all phones, I'm sure it will scratch with use and be more susceptible to breaking.--I could not synchronize the built in calendar with Outlook.  I subscribed to a separate calendar synchronization program from Verizon (iDatebook) which works well but creates a separate calendar rather than using the built in one.--The Razr uses BREW for applications so there are fewer available than in java.  I particularly miss World Mate for international travel (especially the currency converter) and a shopping list application.--It's CMDA only so for for international travel, I've had to unlock an old handset and will just buy prepaid SIMsAll in all, though, the V3m may be my favorite wireless handset of the seven I've owned over the years.","4.0","The VZ Navigator Is Worth the Price","1152662400","07 12, 2006"
"AQ3GHT17PGSBL","B000G7LWRM","Will Klinger","[7, 7]","Overall this is a bad phone. The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD, and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool, which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone, you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera, but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips, but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone, but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin, no antenna, sleek designCons: horrible user interface, very few options to change the appearance, many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else.

For me to give this 4 stars, honestly I have had to use two workarounds:1)  I replaced the terrible ear attachment loop with a jabra ear gel I have left from an old headset.  It works much much better than the Samsung provided ear loop.  I have already broken both ear loops provided with the headset because you have to take them on and off to charge it.  Dumb design.2)  I activate pairing on the device each time I want to switch from my work blackberry to my personal palm phone.  It's a bit annoying, but for $5 its quite doable.I have received compliments on the sound (so much better than the wired headsets I used to use), it is great not to have to constantly fiddle with a cord that gets stuck somewhere, and with the jabra gel it stays in even when my 1 year old is banging me on the head :)Still, for the money, if I had to do it again, I would spring for the $15 (after rebate) WEP 700.

They are reasonably loud and easy to use (volume, On/Off & paring). Charging is simple: drop it in its storage charging case and close the lid.But first, it is somewhat tiny and so you either need to wear it continually in your ear (hardly cool) or risk it getting lost in a purse. And because it is so smooth it does not hang in a bluetooth carrying loop that I had on my cellphone case (slips out).The dedicated charging case is also very small and has a dedicated charger with a unique charging tip (does not work with a mini USB connector or most other charging hubs)But the most disappointing failure was that the headset would inexplicably disconnect from my AT&T; Tilt in the middle of a call and the re-pairing would need to be done all over again.

Yes, its prone to interference, but I've yet to see a unit that doesn't occasionally give you a bit of static (JX10 - I'm looking at you!). Callers were impressed to hear that I was using a headset.2) Pairing - I've always thought this process to be a bit obtuse, but I guess it drives down costs to have the much-vaunted multi-funtion button. I find it annoying. That said, pairing was quick and easy with this unit and it **stays** paired for hours at a time.3) Fit - Stays paired and stays in my ear for hours at a time. Does it hurt? Heck, even my ears can't stand canalphones. I stand at 6 feet and yet I have the earcanals of a 5 year old, I guess. I don't have a problem using this set all day, but my ears are still a bit sore. Still, this is much better than other models I've used (JX10 - I'm still looking at you!). For the record, I'm using the smallest gel. The WEP200 gives you three different sizes.4) Price - one of the cheapest BT headsets around. I've tried expensive, I've tried cheap, I've tried middle of the road. So far, the WEP200 beats em all, even when not factoring in the cost.5) Range - doesn't matter what side of my body this unit is on, it almost always makes a clear connection to the BB 8800. I also use this unit to take VOIP calls via Cisco IP Communicator on my Dell D620 laptop and iChat audio on my Macbook Pro. It gives you just enough freedom to roam. You start loosing your signal at about twenty feet in clear line of sight.Cons -1) Size - Unit is super tiny! It gets lost in my shirt pocket, my jacket pocket, left on the counter. Annoying when you are getting a call and your headset is still paired to your mobile. Its never a fun scramble, especially when someone important is at the other end. Hang on a second! I need to find the headset!!!2) Charger - Not thrilled about the charger/carrying case, but if it helps keep the size of the headset down, I can't complain too much. I feel compelled to get my wife to buy one, just so we'd have two chargers around the house - one for upstairs and another downstairs. They're cheap enough, so why not?Overall, this is the best BT headset I've ever used in the three years that I've been using them.

Despite this challenge, the unit still manages to pick up my voice clearly. I receive fewer complaints from those I call.Unfortunately, the compact design appears to severely affect the battery potential. After 10 months of moderate use, the serviceable charge time of my Samsung has dropped from disappointing to worthless. If turned on but not used, the battery will last up to 22 hours.

"A3N4VTNFPMTHEF","B000GAO9T2","James Lin","[8, 8]","Comfort:The WEP200 is great for people who wear glasses because there isn't an extra hook that goes over your ear.  The tiny loop on the WEP200 earpiece is flexible and does a good job of hooking or bracing the unit in your ear.  You can also rotate it to fit it in your left or right ear.  I've been able to freely talk and move my head around without feeling like the headset would fall out.Battery life:The battery life seems to be shorter than my Plantronics Voyager 510, but it's understandable with the much smaller size of the WEP200.  I really haven't had an issue with the battery, as long as I remember to take it out of the car with me to charge overnight or during the day.  I have to take it with me because, as of March 2008, there doesn't seem to be a car charger accessory for this headset.Update May 2008:  As M. Cirone points out in the comment below, there are now car charger accessories available for the WEP 200!Sound quality:The sound quality isn't as good as my Plantronics Voyager either, but it's still good enough for phone calls.  People on the other end don't seem to have problems understanding me and I can hear them well enough.Ease of use:The buttons are big and easy to reach, but take a little bit of force.  Since the headset is so small though, it's easy enough to hold it in place while you press buttons.I also had no trouble connecting this headset to my Nokia 6300 phone.  In fact, I can switch between this in my car and my Plantronics at home without any issues.Overall, this is an excellent, inexpensive headset, especially for people who wear glasses.  It's definitely tiny though so it's very easy to lose if you're not careful.","4.0","Great product for people who wear glasses","1204329600","03 1, 2008"

The ear loop is cumbersome to put on, and the ear bud by itself will not stay in my average ear. Worse, you have to place the headset in a recharging box (???? What happened to a simple plug??), meaning that the ear loop needs to come off. A Jabra ear gel fits on the unit . . . but the ear piece needs to come off to recharge. The nail in the coffin is that the ear piece volume is terribly low, necessitating a constant shove of a finger to ensure no aural leakage, even in my ultra-quiet Toyota Sequoia. To be fair, the sound quality was reported to to be very good, but the drawbacks far outweigh the pluses.","1.0","Quite simply, overrated","1255132800","10 10, 2009"
"A1WXG10FJ353K0","B000GAO9T2","MickeyJoe","[0, 0]","Ok, seriously, who are the group of dolts at Samsung approving the release of a products like this?  Did they take the time to at least put it in their ear?  I'm writing this because they are making newer models, but with zero design improvements.Problem here is not the function or technical aspect, it's the design.  I have no idea who's ear this is designed for, but it's not for humans.  You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring, that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone.  Not even close.The size is appealing, and the storage case charger is great.  It does work well, low noise, and good range.  However, it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge.  But, if you have to balance it in your ear, and keep still, or hold it, it kinda defeats the purpose.  It being so small and falling out ALL the time also leaves you wondering where it went, and who is either sitting or stepping on it.So, the cheap, flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap.  Plus, there is no place to put it.  The headset goes in it's case, but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where, exactly?  Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out.  That must be where mine is, because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.There are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes.  They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear, or maybe to floss your teeth.  Who knows.  They do nothing, and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you don't use any of the included attachments... but it hurts either way.  I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers.  One set were foam-like wraps... useless.  And some type of rubber things that just did not fit.Samsung WEP-301 Bluetooth Headset (Silver)is the newer model, but it is not any different in design.  However, it's so cheap with rebate, it cost less than the freakin' earbud covers I wasted money on.  Therefore, after this appealing review, and you still want to buy this thing, I would go for the newer one.  But, don't say I (we!) didn't warn you!NOTE: If you are ok with putting superglue in your ear to keep it attached, please disregard this review.","2.0","Great!

"ASO5UIVULSB3Q","B000GAO9T2","Ronald Ih rimb1172","[0, 0]","As others have said, the functionality of this headset is very good. The biggest bonus to me is that it handles the Palm Treo's marginal Bluetooth quite well. My Plantronics Discovery 640 had great sound, mic, and fit, but would always (I mean literally 100% of the time) drop the BT connection about 1 minute after ending a phone call on my Treo 700p and I'd have to reconnect. Even though I am quite sure it is the Treo's fault, I'd rather spend $50 for a new headset than $400 for a new smartphone. With the WEP200, it stays connected all day after many calls.The volume is a little low and it appears that every time you shut it off to recharge, the volume resets to its default middle level. I always have to crank it up to its highest level since it fits rather loosely.Which leads to my main beef: fit. As many have noted fit is this device's biggest weakness. I am using the largest rubber thingy and it is still somewhat loose in my ear. I can shake my head and it won't fall out, but it just doesn't really feel like its well-placed in my ear. I am going to keep it just because it works so well, but it's a serious bummer that this drawback keeps it from being my perfect headset. They must have really small ears in Samsung R&D...;I'll try the Jabra ear gels another poster suggested, or perhaps some foam earphone covers.

That within it self makes it a winner but the Gennum nxZen almost works that good. The difference is I can hear this one with relative ease as opposed to the nxZen. If you boost the microphone (on the nxZen)gain it decreases the in audio which is a issue. I prefer the in-the-ear type headset because I'm always using it in loud places like airports etc. The built in boom slides forward and provides excellent out audio for the receiver. I still, struggle at times, hearing the caller. The talk time, so far, is very good. I can wear it for several hours but at some point my ear does start hurting.I use this with my Treo 700w.

When you use it as an in-ear only headset, there is a tiny (barely noticeable, but there) amount of static. The person on the other end never complains. I do like the fact that for $20 you can convert it into to different styles.Two suggestions:1) I STRONGLY suggest using the included ear foam in either configuration. This makes the unit fit tighter and reduces background noise. This way you can turn down the volume a bit and the sound is clearer.2) Tinker with the volume on your phone AND the headset.

Since the Motorola and Cardo simply hang free once the ear loop is draped over your ear, it ensures the ear loop is sitting atop your ear. In the case of the Soyo FreeStyler 500, once the ear piece is inserted into my ear, the loop actually hangs above my ear and the bluetooth falls off. If you're not following me here, just be aware that if your ears are small to average this may not be the bluetooth for you. There is also an option to not wear it over your ear, and in fact I may try that but I'm not sure that option is any better than just using the included handsfree wire that came with my phone. The flashing is pretty annoying, but all of my bluetooth units have had that, so I get used to it. It charged up quickly and has been holding charge very well. I like the fact that the volume is controlled by two seperate controls. Volume up is on the top of the bluetooth and the volume down is on bottom of the bluetooth, unlike my Motorola and Cardo units.

"A1OZA52DFY3SHD","B000GUKT9Q","Gaz Rendar","[3, 3]","The Motorola H350 bluetooth headset is one of the cheaper models out there, and it shows.PAIRINGThe H350 pairs like most bluetooth headsets. Tell your phone to search for headsets, then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds. Your phone finds the H350 and you hit ok. This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset. I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone.COMFORT/DESIGNThe H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear. The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes. Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset. I definitely cannot say that about the H350. The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal. There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker.SOUND QUALITYI've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare. Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different. People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little far-away. I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing). When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up. This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity. As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present.OVERALLAt it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works. You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset). However, it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked. I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price. If you need higher quality, you may want to open your wallet a little more and look into that Plantronics 640-665 line.","3.0","Only decent quality.

Here are some of the pros and cons so you can get some basis for comparison when purchasing one BT headset:PROS1. Price. I got this device for $33. I don't think you can get a comparable BT headset for a lower price.2. Sound Quality. This device has good volume level and low static.  I have streched it all the way to the range limit (30 ft.) and the call quality is still good with no static.  I have left my phone or computer in the living room/middle level of my townhome and have gone up and down the stairs to other rooms without loosing the call.3. Compatibility.  I haven't had any issues pairing this device up with the following devices: Motorola PEBL, Nokia E62 and HP Pavillion laptop. I have used remote commands such as voice commands, redial or answer with the two phones with no issues, and have used it with Skype and MSN Messenger without any problem.  One user commented that the personalized/group ring tones did not transmit to the BT headset, but this is a limitation of the phone, because the MotoPEBL does not transmit a specific ring tone assigned to a person, and rather a default one, but the Nokia E62 sends the proper ring tone to the headset so you know who is calling without having to look at the phone (good when driving!)4. Battery life.  I have not tried really long calls so I can not comment on exact talk time, but overall I have used it continously in stand-by plus regular calls (for me 10-15 minutes, 4-5 calls a day) without recharging for 3-4 days.CONS:1. Bad Design.  As noted by other users, the device wiggles in your ear and you feel it is going to fall when you walk, move your head (sudden movements) or even driving (believe it or not, the inertia when making turns on you car makes this BT headset to move away from your ear, almost falling).  A strong wind will knock it out from your ear.  It fits ok, though, and does not hurt your ear (not heavy at all).  Perhaps that is the main reason why it wiggles so much, maybe it is too light.2. Powering on/off.  Since it only has one main button (two small ones for volume +/- and mute) that you use for power, pairing, answering or dial commands, then you can, for example, get into pairing mode when simply turning it on, or if attached to a phone, you may redial a call rather than turning it off.  Once you learn how to use it and pay attention to the blue led signals, it is ok, but I think it requires one extra button for power on/off.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase. If it weren't for the two CONs, I would have rated it with 5 starts.","4.0","Good Price. Good sound. Bad design.","1173225600","03 7, 2007"

So after a few hours of reading reviews on a dozen or so different headsets, I finally decided just to settle for the H500, I was really interested in some of the Plantronics sets, but she didn't care for the design.. I was a little worried about the H500 because the reviews are kinda so-so.. They're either good reviews or bad reviews.  I got it for her so she wouldn't have to fumble around in the car with a phone so how it performs in a vehicle was going to be the make or break point with it.  I'm pleased to say that the headset performs way better than I expected it to.Getting started is a breeze.  All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours (the LED light will go off once the battery is charged) once it's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone.  All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit, then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone (For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000)  The phone saved the settings and we were all set.Using the headset is no brainer basically.  There 3 buttons; Main call/multi button & Volume up & down buttons.  Pressing these buttons in various combos will yield different results like mute, hold, transfer, 3-way, etc. The retail package comes with a handy fold out that has all the functions and how to access them.The build quality of the headset is great as well.. The headset is about 2 inches from earclip to mic.  Its very small and very comfortable to wear.  The ear clip is removable to you can use it on either ear as well.  The buttons feel solid as well.Now to the actual sound quality.  The headset has performed great in all the scenarios we've tried so far.. Which has been in the house while watching TV, In the car with the stereo & windows up & down & in an office environment.  I was most impressed with how it performed while driving, There is no static or any background noise at all and even with the radio and window down, the user can clearly be heard both ways.  Again very impressive.  The only environment we haven't really tried yet was at the store.  I will update once I've tested that as well.I can't really comment on the battery life yet, because we've only had the unit for a day or so, but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged.So to summarize, great headset overall, feels & looks great, sound quality is super, voices are loud and clear.  Performance in the car, home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail.  I'm very very satisfied (and relieved!) that this unit performs as well as it does.","5.0","Fantastic headset at a great price.","1173225600","03 7, 2007"

"ASHMKDJI9Q3K4","B000GX9D9K","K. Gehrke","[1, 2]","Item was purchased to replace a Motorola 300 headset. Worked ok but, paired fast. Volume was ok but could have been louder. Biggest drawbacks were callers could barely hear me if I was not using my 'outside' voice which is annoying to others around you. The other complaint is the fit. I still do not understand how Motorola engineers enjoy this design. It feels like it is going to fall off and on occasion does. Item was returned within 30 day policy of where it was purchased. Here is where I am at currently with headsets....this is my review for the cardo scala 700lx that I currently own and am very happy with so far. I feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price.My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.","2.0","Poor fit, average function","1215907200","07 13, 2008"

If you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times.....  but if you want to turn it off, thats a whole different story.  Powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it.  Add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function.  I have FREQUENTLY called someone just by trying to turn off the device.  The button is also entirely too sensitive.  I've had the device in my cargo pants pocket (where this would be very little pressure on the device) and the unit has turned on and actually called someone.Other issues are the charging indication isn't real clear and there isn't any idea of knowing how charged the battery is and the device isn't quite as comfortable as other devices that I have used (its bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money).","1.0","It works but has VERY annoying quirks","1205020800","03 9, 2008"

Also, the case wraps to the front of the screen and protrudes about 1/16 beyond the glass so it protects the screen if the phone is accidentally slid across the floor or it's dropped flat on the glass.  My only gripe is an aesthetic one but that's very subjective... and I don't think most Galaxy Note owners are very critical about aesthetics.

They don't fit your ear, they echo, callers can't undertand you, the battery dies too quickly...  I purchased this item about a month ago, and haven't found any of these complaints to hold true for this headset.I've charged it once, and haven't had to re-charge it yet.  Sure, I've only made 5 or 6 short calls on it, but it's turned on for at least an hour a day during my commute.My wife could tell that I was calling from my car, but she didn't notice a difference between normal road noise and the Bluetooth reception.The headset fits my ear comfortably.  You probably have already read that this set doesn't insert into your ear canal, but rather rests against it.  I found this to be comfortable, and without any side-effects.  It's even comfortable when wearing sunglasses.I've never heard and echo, nor received complaints of others hearing one.Many reviewers of this and other models seem to dislike the multi-function button.  Well, it's a single button, and it's used to perform multiple functions.  Sometimes you press it for a few seconds, sometimes you just tap it.  I primarily use it for 'on' and 'off'.  'On' takes about 2 seconds, and 'off' takes about 5 or 6 seconds (although I have to admit, it seems to take just a bit longer than I'd prefer...) to turn off.  I'm not sure why some would complain about this feature, as most phones have one...I'm not sure what all the fuss is from other reviewers (more often on other brands...), but this headset seems perfect to me.","5.0","Solid headset, good value","1185494400","07 27, 2007"

Not only did it sound a lot worse to people on the other end, but it sounded a lot more choppy on my receiving end as well.It stays in my ear fairly well, even without the ear loop -- just the eargel.  BUT...The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket, bag, or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket-clip charger.  If I have it clipped on my pocket, the eargel faces out and unavoidably rotates to its removal position.  When I brush up against anything the eargel flips out.  I've lost two eargels now and it just sits in a drawer.They should have designed a better retention mechanism on the eargel with some kind of positive release mechanism, and/or have the eargel facing back when it's in the clip in a pocket so it won't get torn off.I also hated the force required on the buttons.  I never used the volume controls (always did it from the phone), and I dreaded getting calls because I'd have to MASH the answer button into my head.One more thing -- It's always getting unpaired from my Treo 680.  I have to go through the Treo menus to get it to pair again.  To be honest, this may have to do with the Treo more than the headset, but the two do not like each other that well.The Discovery 650 without the DSP had much better audio quality, slightly lighter force on the buttons, but the same problems with eargels getting torn off in my pocket.--- UPDATE ---I called Plantronics tech support and they immediately sent me out new eargels.  So I'm using it again.","2.0","Bad Choice","1217376000","07 30, 2008"

It works, but it could be much much better.First, I think technology still has a long way to go with regards to bluetooth/wireless headsets.  Sound quality on this thing, while loud enough, made everyone sound like they were talking through several layers of tshirts. Everyone I've spoken to on this says they can tell I'm on something but that I sound fine.  Fine isn't good enough for me.Let's talk design: It absolutely excels in the Cool department - it looks slick and isn't some chubby ear thing.  But, with that cool looking factor comes a lose and ill-fitting earpiece.  Yes, it comes with 3 replacable earpieces, but none fit me quite right. I would like to offer this suggestion to all who own/consider owning this: When you are trying to insert this into your ear, take your hand opposite the side of the ear you are putting this in, grab the top of your earlobe and pull up while twisting this thing into your ear canal. I got it to fit OK but walking around with it - it feels like it's going to fall out any second.The buttons: Yes they are small but we are all aware that as technology shrinks, so are the buttons. Yes, they are difficult to use, but I'm used to it and you should be too.  Main problem: Is that you really have to press down for the buttons to click, and this thing is already ready to fall out of your ear, so trying to slam on a button isn't helping.  Why someone doesn't put a nice little trackwheel for volume on one of these things is beyond me.You can walk around with this but you'll want to keep your phone nearby - I walked into the next room not more than 10 feet from the phone and it got static, etc.  Pretty weak if you ask me.It works OK. It paired up with my Motorolla KRZR just fine and works no problem. I wonder if the Motorolla headsets work better with Motorola phones.The main reason I got it is for when I drive because I don't like being on my cell while driving and everyone seems to want to call me when I'm driving.  For that purpose it is acceptable.  I guess my expectations are too high for this technology... again.","3.0","Bluetooth headsets still not good enough.","1165795200","12 11, 2006"

If you are a totally predictable person who does the same thing every day and never gets dirt on your cuffs, it's ok. If you are on the go, the wire clip will come loose in your pocket or in your computer bag. The pen holder doesn't do anything to shield the clip, in fact it adds weight that causes more force against the exposed headset. I had to recrimp the loop to make it tight enough not to come loose. The pen cap itself is required baggage for no good reason. Rather than give you a standard mini usb connector on the device, you must now haul this cap everywhere. Hey, I don't always wear a shirt with pockets. After two weeks I misplaced it on a trip and so the expensive headset is sitting on the shelf while I ponder whether to buy another useless pen clip or to cook up my own connector. There is no excuse for non-standard connectors and charging solutions, but watch this company do it over again.(several months later) I finally am tossing out this headset. The pen clip holder was eventually found and I tried to make a go with this device. I don't like to get rid of working items, but I have had the earpiece and ear hook fall off many times in my pocket and this last time, they fell elsewhere and are lost. Would you believe it couldn't even stand up to the pressure of the inside of my suit coat? I did get a box to carry it in, but that was cumbersome because of the charging holder, and now it doesn't matter because I would have to buy a new hook and earpiece. Just ordered a Motorola H500, lower cost, lots of color choices and very long talk time PLUS a standard mini USB jack. I got a travel case for less than $4.

"A1ZM846Y7AUYD","B000HBIUNG","M. Pickering","[5, 5]","When I saw pictures and read the details about this Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP Bluetooth headset I just knew I would have to have one.  I have owned several Bluetooth headsets in the past, most made by Motorola, and I have always continued looking for something that would stay in place and sound good to both myself and the people that I call.  I just can't seem to find a Bluetooth wireless headset that shines in all of the important areas.  They either fit lousy or sound lousy or both!  This new headset from Plantronics looked to be the answer to my search for near perfection.  It is very lightweight, fits snug in my ear, and has a very impressive appearence.  It even comes with a multitude of charging accessories, to allow you to charge from a standard 110 volt household outlet, charge from a USB port on a home or office computer, and even charge from a single AAA alkaline battery.  The headset provides very good tonal sound quality to the user and the sound output is quite good for the person on the other end of the conversation.  What more could a person want from a wireless headset?  How about decent phone to headset reception?  Even with my Motorola Razr V3 and Razr MaxxVE cellular phones clipped to the belt around my waist I still experience constant reception problems.  There is noticeable crackling and popping sounds and sometimes brief cutout of the conversation.  Although the people on the other end of my conversations say that they notice only slight flaws in the sound, I find the amount of noise in the reception to be distracting and very annoying.  The proximity of my phone to the headset doesn't seem to be the problem at all.  Most of the time the headset is less than 3 feet from the cell phone it is paired with.  I have tried the headset with both my work phone and personal phone, as well as with my wife's phone.  Changing phones has no effect on the reception problems.  To add further frustration, the headset does not work properly with the voice-dial feature of my phones.  All of my previous Bluetooth headsets would allow you to push the call button, which would prompt the cell phone to activate the voice-dialing feature.  This Plantronics model requires you to manually activate the voice-dial feature from the telephone itself or to punch in the phone number yourself.  This really prevents me from using the headset as a safer means of calling from my car while traveling.  I constantly receive compliments from friend and coworkers regarding how sleek the headset looks.  But that just doesn't offset all of the shortcomings this headset has in terms of reception and functionality.  The Plantronics Discovery 655 has a great look and an abundance of extras that are included in the package.  However, if you are looking for reliable Bluetooth headset that will offer great sound and above average reception then I would recommend that you look elsewhere.  I still give this item an overall rating of 3 stars because of its design, lightweight, comfortable fit and variety of charging options.  They just need to give it better compatability with hands-free voice dialing and much stronger Bluetooth communication with the cell phone it is paired with.","3.0","Perfection From Plantronics?

The device I had before that, was the Cardo Scala 500. I'd bought that one from Amazon and wound up returning it due to low volume. The HS850 suffered the same symptom. I found myself constantly pressing the headset to my ear while I was listening and turning up the volume which caused a distracting echo for the person I was talking to.So, one of the features I was looking for was a device in which the microphone was not too close to the earpiece. The Discovery 655 seemed to fit the bill. I also read some good reviews on it. I was pleased when I first tried it on and found that it went right into my ear for a perfect fit. This is important for two reasons: 1) I wear glasses so, it's nice not to have to deal with a loop, 2) I think having the earpiece so close to my inner ear precludes me from having to turn up the volume. In fact, I haven't touched the volume at all. This is the first bluetooth device that I've been happy with right out of the box.

I had read a lot of reviews on multiple sites that indicated that a lot of bluetooth headsets didn't provide a clear signal.  Based on the cnet review I assumed the 655 was different.This being my first bluetooth headset, I'm not exactly sure what the standard is.  However, the Plantronics literature for this model clearly states that users will have 33 feet to roam.  In my experience, using a Blackberry 8700g, this is just false.  I get a clear signal 8 to 10 feet away from my phone.  After that the static kicks in and and increases dramatically as the distance increases.  Maybe Plantronics is just copying the hyperbole of other manufactuers.  Nonetheless,I'm not sure if I would have purchased this model if I had known that I was limited to 10 feet at most.With that said, I do find that reception is very clear within the 8 foot range.  Also, the volume control is excellent.  I found it easier to hear voices with the 955 than anything I'd experienced with a dozen corded headsets.The accessories are probably the biggest selling point.  The 955 comes with three earpieces and can be recharged via a AAA battery, USB or with a provided electrical adapter.If you're looking for a bluetooth set that provides clear reception beyond 10 feet (like they claim they're supposed to) then I wish you luck.  As of late 2006, based on reviews I've read, I wasn't able to find a single headset that gave that kind of reception.  It seems that bluetooth headsets are not yet ready for prime time.","3.0","Great accessories.  Works OK with a Blackberry, but distance claims are fiction","1158537600","09 18, 2006"

She found the 330 painfully uncomfortable and decided to sacrifice style for comfort (quite a departure from her typical choices, particularly regarding footwear); thus she is now enjoying my 510 and I'm getting by with the 330. I don't find the 330 uncomfortable for the first few hours, but I never forget it's in my ear like I did with the 510. If you have very small ears, it's probably a bad choice.Here's a brief comparison between the two with my 5 point ratings:STYLE & DESIGNI greatly prefer the 330's single side button that makes it very easy adjust the volume. On the 510, I found the volume and power buttons behind the ear difficult to reach and easy to confuse - probably my biggest complaint with the 510.I prefer the look and size of the 330. It's more modern and discreet. However, it's not a fashion accessory and everyone looks like a dork with a flashing blue light next to their ear with any BT headset. I wish people would realize this and take these things off in public (especially in restaurants). I only use mine in the car or when at the computer so this is the least important criteria for me.COMFORTThe 510 is the clear winner here for both me and my wife. Everyone's ear is different and I find the 330 less uncomfortable than my wife did. A few may find the 330 fits them better than the 510, but the 510 includes 3 ear pieces to provide a custom fit.PERFORMANCEThis is the best reason to get the 510. I've used worse headsets than the 330, but none better than the 510. With the 330, I get static if the phone is on the other side of body from the headset. The 330's claimed 30' range - maybe at high altitude with no obstructions, no other radio interference with no solar flares and a full moon - real world, more like 10' with no obstructions.Noise canceling is far superior on the 510. People would never guess I was using a headset - usually they couldn't even tell when I was in my car. The 330 is about useless in a windy environment and picks up a lot of background noise.Both headsets seem to have very good battery life and audio quality for listening. The 510 also has the advantage of being able to pair with 2 devices simultaneously but I've never tried this feature.STYLE & DESIGN330 - 4510 - 2COMFORT330 - 3510 - 5PERFORMANCE330 - 3510 - 5FEATURES & PRICE330 - 4  (probably better than most headsets &lt; $30)510 - 5  (more expensive but worth it for features and performance)OVERALL330 - 3510 - 5The comfort and performance of the 510 justify the extra $16.","3.0","Plantronics Explorer 330 vs. Plantronics Voyager 510","1204848000","03 7, 2008"
"A215IN14OKAE2T","B000HBMP82","Thew Thew","[1, 1]","Plantronics makes the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost. No contest. I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone, Sennheiser, BlueParrot, Motorolla, Blue Trek, and god only knows which others. Plantronics is the only brand I've purchased more than 1 of. While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does, none of them can compare on battery life, consistency of connection, or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear, but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it. The only headset I've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser, but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.Background noise suppression is stereotypical, if there's noise, the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it. The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone, so doing something productive like washing dishes won't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with, but they will hear some level of noise(the Jawbone is brutally painful for that!). I think this is the 5th or maybe 6th plantronics I've bought, and I'm sure it won't be the last.On a side note, the battery, under constant daily use, should last you approximately 500 charges, or 1.5 years avg.

Then I used it less and less, because the thing had to be recharged at home and would only last about an hour.  Soon I thought it was just too hard to use ... hard to put on, and totally weird in that to turn it on you had to take it OFF your ear, flip down the mouthpiece, then put it BACK on your ear.  Whoever designed the thing had no clue how people use headsets.  It also sounded like I was talking from the bottom of a water well.  Whenever I used it on conference calls people would yell for me to go on mute.  So I started asking people in the waiting rooms at airports what brand they had and what brand they liked.  I got so many people who hated Jabra that I didn't even consider it.  I already didn't really care for Motorola, so I started looking at Nokia, which seem to be nice but clumsy, and then I kept meeting more and more people who were in love with their Plantronics.  I have used Plantronics headsets for a long time in the office, after all, that's all they do and they seem to do it well.  I looked at a few Plantronics and didn't find one that jumped out at me, then one day I ran across the Explorer 350.  This was just too good to be true!  Are you kidding me, $49 bucks for a Bluetooth headset made by the top brand?  Then I looked closer and found that Plantronics did something very unique with this headset.  Instead of having to charge it at home, it comes with an extremely cool little clip that either mounts to your dash or hooks to your air vent in your car then plugs into your cigarette lighter.  Now that made sense!  A place to hold the headset where you use it most, always charging, then ready to use in a second or to walk around the rest of the day with it fully charged.  For us road warriors, Plantronics also thoughtfully included a USB charging cable so the trusty laptop will keep your headset charged while you sleep.  You can buy an optional AC adapter if that makes you feel more secure.  So how is it built and how does it perform?  Built like a Hummer!  The main piece is one solid chunk that looks like it is pretty immune to any normal damage while clunking around in your pocket with a lot of coins.  The piece that goes around your ear looks like it is solid as well, and effortlessly switches from ear to ear and slips on with one easy motion.  After the first time, this thing slips on with no thought on my part and instantly is in the perfect position for use.  Operation couldn't be simpler.  Unlike my Motorola with several switches that you had to remember how and what sequence to push them in, the Plantronics has one switch.  Push it in to turn it on, push it in to turn it off, push it in to talk, push it in to hang up, push it in to voice dial, etc.  All you have to do is push.  Want to make it louder or quieter?  Push up or push down.  No-brainer.  I saved performance for last because this is what convinced me to keep it.  After a quick charge I called a friend from my car with the window rolled down.  This is a friend I talk to all the time from my land line.  I said, hey, I just bought a new Bluetooth headset and want to see how it sounds to you.  He said, cool, put it on and I'll let you know.  I said ... I already have it on!  He said the sound was perfect, no background noise of any kind and it sounded at least as good as my landline.  One of the things several of my airport buddies told me they liked about Plantronics is how the durable rubber earpiece fits comfortably inside your ear and blocks out noise ... like annoying flight announcements.  I have to say that not only did I sound perfect to my friend but every call I have been on has been easier to hear than with any other headset I have ever tried.PROS:Sound QualitySuperior constructionEase of usePairing - instant and flawlessPriceComfortCONS:None I could see.

"A1W5N8OT55A9Y3","B000HBPMVY","B. Christensen Frequent traveler, business o...","[3, 3]","I purchased this unit primarily to use with my MacBook and Skype for conducting business calls.  Previously I was using the Logitech Clear Chat Pro wired USB headset with very good results, but after breaking a couple of them by accidentally yanking the cords from my Mac, I wanted to try a wireless solution.  So far, the results have been mixed.  Here are some highlights:1. Build Quality - 3 starsThe build quality seems pretty good, especially for something in this price range.  The construction is mostly all plastic, but the hinge mechanisms and stress points appear to be adequately constructed.  I would NOT expect these headsets to stand up to much abuse - e.g. extensive travel where they are jammed in and out of a bag, dropped on the ground, etc.  For daily office or home use where they are place into a drawer or on a desk when not in use, they should give a good service life.  People have complained that the foam earpieces fall off, but after a couple weeks of use, I have not seen any indications of this problem.  The switches all operate smoothly, and while the overall design is a bit clunky, that is more an aesthetic comment than a quality comment.2. Features - 4 starsThe headset has a good feature set, supporting both the stereo headphone profile (A2DP) and the headset profile.  I have used these with both my Mac and my iPhone and with the Mac both profiles work, with easy switching between the two using the Bluetooth Preferences drop down for on-the-fly changes.  With the iPhone, only the headset profile is supported (this is an iPhone limitation, NOT a limitation of this headset).  Buttons for volume, skip/fast forward, skip/fast rewind work well with iTunes on the laptop.  Only the volume controls and call answer/end buttons seem to work with the iPhone in the headset mode.3. Operation/usage  - 2 starsPairing with both the Mac and the iPhone was absolutely seamless, and switching between the two is fairly straightforward, though I have not tried to have the headset paired and connected to both devices - I'm not sure this works.  For now, I disable Bluetooth on my iPhone when it is nearby and I want to pair the PT590 to my Macbook, because otherwise the PT590 will connect to its last device, which is usually my iPhone when on the road.  The comfort of these headphones is so-so - the ear pads are relatively small, and the over-the-head band is quite tight (and I have a small head).  I can imagine that they would be quite uncomfortable for anyone with a large melon.  Stretching the band would be dangerous, since it is made of plastic and would probably break.  perhaps heating it with a blow dryer and gently stretching it out might work...  The foam ear pads are thin, and since the ear pieces press pretty firmly against the head, they do cause minor discomfort after some period of time.  They are no where near as comfortable as my Bose QCII headphones, but these are $60 and the Bose are $300, so I would expect that to be the case.  They are more comfortable than other headphones I have had in this &lt;$100 price range, including both wired and wireless units.  I would not recommend them for all-day use sitting at a desk (get the Bose and live with the wires), but for short stints they are great.The blue light is annoying, but it is also an important status indicator for things like call status and battery life.  It is one of the ways my wife knows when I am on a call in my office when she walks in to talk to me.Operating the unit is very easy - answering a call, you touch a button, the same button ends the call. For listening to music, the controls are a bit less intuitive - the top and bottom buttons skip forward or reverse, and the front and rear buttons increase or decrease the volume - this seems like it was not thought out very well, as the functions between the two pairs of buttons should be swapped to be more intuitive.The pull-out boom for the mic is a nice feature, and there is a built-in wind screen.  I have not tried these units in windy conditions but would expect their performance to exceed many other mini headsets for mobile phone usage.One nit I have is that in order to get the boom mic to point down towards one's mouth, the headband needs to sit pretty far forward on the head - it feels slightly unnatural.  So this leaves you with the choice of either tilting the whole setup forward to angle the mic towards the mouth, or put them on feeling more natural, but have the mic pointed up at one's nose/cheek.Note:  I use these headphones alongside a logitech bluetooth mouse and have been surprised at how little interference there is between the two.  Occasionally my mouse will freeze, but a click will usually quickly restore service to the mouse.  There is no static induced in the headphones by the mouse that I can discern.4. Performance - 4 stars for music,  2 stars for SkypeOverall performance of these units is quite good, with the exception of VOIP or Skype calling.4.1 Music - music sounds surprisingly full and rich, given that these units are small and rather flimsy feeling (e.g. lightweight).  The are on the ear style headphones, so they do not offer any passive noise reduction, and the sound leakage from the outside into the ears as well as from the 'phones to the outside is pretty significant (I can't watch a movie on my laptop in bed while my wife is trying to sleep - something I do routinely with my Bose QCII headphones).  But for average music listening, they are really surprisingly good.  By tweaking the EQ settings, you can get them to sound as good or better than many wired headphones in this price range, and the amount of stutter or static is surprisingly low.4.2 Skype - 1 star - I cannot recommend these units for Skype - Out use.  This may be a limitation of Bluetooth for VOIP calling, as I have not tried other Bluetooth sets, the amount of lag introduced by these units is unacceptable for business-level conversation.  I know that this is not a limitation of Skype, as I previously used a wired Logitech headset with very good results with Skype.  The lag can vary in severity, but even at its best, it is noticeable - almost like talking to someone over a satellite connection where there is several hundred milliseconds of delay.  It can get annoying very quickly.  At its worst, it is totally unusable, as people I am talking to hear nothing but static and garbled speech.  I have reached the point where I really only use them when I am on long conference calls where I just have to listen for 95% of the time.  For real calls, I have had to go back to using my cell phone.4.3 Phone - 5 stars - probably the best quality audio (both mic and speakers) that I have used with my iPhone or my Motorola Razr.  The headphones are big and dorky looking while walking through an airport, but boy, they sure stay on your head when you lean over to pick up your bag, and they seem to do a great job of filtering out background noise.Overall, the performance of these units is very good for the price.  If you are buying them for music and /or for use with a phone (especially one that supports the A2DP profile)  I highly recommend them - you cannot beat the performance at this price point.  For use with Skype at a desktop computer, I cannot recommend them, and suggest you use a wired USB or audio jack type headset.","3.0","Great for music, not so great for Skype","1233273600","01 30, 2009"

"A3O1I9YJR8YWUX","B000HBPMVY","Joy Morgan","[72, 72]","After reading the reviews on this product, I wasn't sure what to expect because the reviews were so varied in their complaints.The key things I've noted after several weeks of use:1) The blinking blue light isn't any more noticeable or obnoxious than any other Bluetooth headset I've used. Meaning, it's bright and somewhat annoying, but fairly normal, better than some in fact. The only way I could see it being a problem is in a small space at night. Say a car. But if you're driving with both ears covered, you've got more problems than blinking blue lights.2) The sound quality is better than 90% of the Bluetooth headsets I've tried. Way better than Jabra or Motorola. From a call perspective, it's about the same, but as a stereo headset, it's so much better. I can listen to opera and hear the high and low vocals without distortion, which was impossible on the last Jabra I had.3) It requires a pairing code!!! This is important to note. You can't pair it with a device that doesn't allow you to enter a code! So, it won't work with an off-the-shelf 3.5 or 2.5mm adapter. It pairs fine with my computer with built-in Bluetooth, and one of my cell phones because I can enter the code. It does not work with the Bluetooth dongle I bought for my MP3 player because no way to enter a pairing code. Also doesn't work with the USB Bluetooth radio I bought for my other PC. This I found annoying and was the chief reason I dropped a star from the rating. One way around this is to buy the 590A model, rather than the 590E model (the model I'm reviewing) because it comes with a paired adapter. However, the cost is much higher.4) Yes, as others have noted, this headset is made of hard plastic. The more flexible material many of us are used to in headphones is completely absent here. So, if you sit on them, as one user mentioned, you will break them. So don't sit on them. They're not tiny, so they're hardly unobtrusive.5) They are the rare over-the-head headphones. Most Bluetooth these days are behind the neck. I like behind the neck styles, but with very long hair, they're not the best option in the world. These stay on and are comfortable through several hours of wear, and haven't pulled out a single hair yet. My Jabra headphones ripped hair out constantly.6) The controls are mostly nice. I like that they're all on one ear. Some other sets have the controls spread out over the two ear phones, which I find annoying. The one thing I don't like in the controls is that I naturally think of volume as UP DOWN and tracks as BACK FORWARD. The controls are the complete opposite, which is odd to me. The UP button is track forward, the DOWN button is track back. The FORWARD button is volume up and the BACK button is volume down. I don't know who thought of that of that bit of engineering, but it shouldn't have made it out of the drawing room.Overall, I'm very happy with these headphones, there are some minor annoyances, but that can be said for every Bluetooth headphone on the market. The most important thing to me was that the sound quality be good for music play. I have many headsets for phone calls, but this was the first one that had nice music quality. I just wish it worked with a standard Bluetooth adapter. Perhaps next time.","4.0","Mixed bag, but overall a good buy","1189209600","09 8, 2007"

They are easy to pair, feel comfortable and the sound quality is very good. Battery life is fairly long - for my use, almost a week. The Bluetooth adapter that comes with 590A fits very snugly into the iPod 3.5 mm audio jack (unlike many others). Telescopic microphone is unobtrusive, works well on cell phones and the listeners at other end don't complain of poor voice quality.The main drawback of these headsets is their flimsy construction, cheap plastic. One of the cables became loose after a year and the plastic casing on one side cracked. So the sound from one side is intermittent now. Other cons include tiny and poorly placed controls - almost unusable while wearing headsets, very bright blue light and they do not cover the ears completely so there is no blockage of background sound.They are not the perfect Bluetooth headphones but in my experience they have worked better than the other ones that I have tried - iLUV 903 and Logitech","3.0","Good Performance, Easy Pairing, Flimsy Construction","1219104000","08 19, 2008"

I tried to listen to music as I fell asleep.  My wife snapped Turn those things off, that light is going to give me a seizure!  Even if I am sitting in a room by myself, the light is annoying.  I like to listen to music in a dimly lit room.  I can see the flashing light while I am wearing the headphones, and it is totally distracting.  My head looks like a safety beacon at the airport.  There is no way to turn the light off.  I did try going to bed wearing the headphones with a sock over the earpiece.  That sort of worked, but what a ridiculous thing to have to do.

IMHO, the Scala 700 right now is the best bang for the buck. This is my second product from Cardo Scala - the first being the 500, which was also a great headset. The 500 had great sound on both ends and was more than loud enough. Most other headsets suffer from earpiece volume that is just not loud enough. Also the lack of noise cancellation and wind noise reduction on the other headsets made them only useful in the office or a quiet car. The Scala 700 windguard technology is not perfect - but performs much better than anything else I have tried. The 700 is about 1/3 smaller than the 500 and performs just as well in every aspect. The buttons and controls are easy to use and intuitive. It takes a little tweaking to adjust the headset for a comfortable fit, but after some bending and shaping of the earpiece, the headset was very stable and comfortable.

Very nice addition for this price.I've only had it for a week and it is holding up well (you get a padded velcro carrying case too) but my initial impression, to be honest, was that it seemed a little too fragile - again it's very small and light.

It's snug, it doesn't flop around at all. It fits in a different way from your traditional ear plug device but in many ways it's more comfortable because it's not sitting in your outer ear canal but slightly further outside.So if you're thinking about ordering this device, I'd recommend buying it.

They all had pairing issues - either they won't pair with the phone or they don't stay paired.  And the volume was not loud enough.  I returned at least 5 headsets until I came across this one.  The sound quality is maybe an 8 out of 10 but the volume is unbelievable, and this coming from a guy that doesn't have the best hearing.  I can actually hear the person on the line - all the time.  Even in noisy environments.  No complaints from people on the receiving end except when I'm in the home and the mircowave oven is running (this will scramble almost all BT frequencies).  Buttons are placed well and they are very responsive.Initial pairing was a breeze and the 700 connects to my phone flawlessly on virtually every call.  In the two weeks I've owned it, I think it failed to connect on two occasions and I make well over 50 calls/day.  This compares to the 75% connect rate I realized with other BT headsets.Battery life is a 10 out of 10.  I charge the headset every day but I often talk 5-6 hours in one day without recharging.  Just amazing!  They claim 10 hours (which it may actually achieve) but I'm amazed it can actually make it past 5 hours.The range is not that great but I can't fault the headset as Treo is known to incorporate substandard BT electronics into their phones - which make the range very, very poor.  Once in a while, if the phone is in my right pocket and headset in my left ear, there is a slight crackling noise.  It's not bad though, but can be annoying.  Pulling it out of my pocket immediately relieves the problem.Whatever you do, don't attempt to test the buzzer feature when the headset is in your ear - the buzzing is LOUD when it's placed right in the ear.  But if you needed to find it if lost in the room, be prepared to make the room very quiet to locate it.  It relies on the internal speaker to create the buzzing sound.Nice to have TWO chargers available in the retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter and one USB charger).  The carrying case was useless but a nice add nonetheless.I would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650.

I also had theSony MDR-RF925RK 900 MHz Analog RF Wireless Headphone, which were good at canceling outside noises, but produced so much static and whitenoise that they were useless.When I came across the S805 I went ahead and gave them a try.

What I use them for is to watch movies/anime and play the PS3.They are hooked up to my Yamaha HTR-5640 Home Theater Receiver using aSony Bluetooth Transmitter and Adapter for iPod and MP3 Players. Unless your receiver has Bluetooth built in, you'll need a transmitter. Just be sure it supports A2DP. I had theJabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor, but it didn't work with the S805 because it wasn't A2DP compliant.Overall, I love the quality of the connection: no whitenoise, no static. There is the occasional dropped signal, but that's easily and quickly restored. I purchased these in December of 2008, and in March of 2011 they still work like a charm.","5.0","Perfect for watching movies","1301443200","03 30, 2011"

The padding on them makes them very comfortable, something my other headphones lack on the part that goes over the head. And it's great to be able to control volume, pause/play, and skip through songs right from the headphones.The pairing has been a bit confusing for me, though. I've had some trouble trying to get it into paring mode. It's had to figure out what mode it's in from the blinking light. I haven't been able to get it to pair with both my phone and my iPod's adapter. Either one of those works, though.I haven't tested out the battery life in full, but it's lasted through 2 hours without having a problem.It would also be nice to be able to use them while they are charging.","4.0","Cool accessory, a bit confusing","1247616000","07 15, 2009"
"A1BJOHHLG0D965","B000HDTXDA","M.D. Edwards Avid Aesthete","[0, 0]","This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, and I opted for this style because I want a set of headphones for my phone that will truly deliver the music quality and sound that I'm looking for, and I want that to come in a pair of headphones that feel like they're worth the money I paid for them. These headphones easily fulfill both of these desires for me, and then some!These Motorola headphones are NOT lightweight, but they also won't have you feeling overly weighed down, either. They're simply solid-feeling in weight and construction. I read many other reviews of these online, one from an owner who has owned these headphones over the course of at least a year and a half, and who paid over $120.00 for his pair. Considering the price that I got these for (comparable to the prices that I found for these here on Amazon), I feel like I got mine at a steal, at less than $40.00!These Motorola headphones FEEL like they're worth $150.00, and the stereo sound that comes from them is great. The sound is crisp, clear, and has plenty of depth to it for my taste. I didn't find these headphones to be lacking in their production of bass. No, the bass in these ISN'T going to blow your eardrums out, but I like to have all of the sound elements enhance the overall effect of the music, not overpower it.As far as taking calls on these go, there is no obvious microphone on these, but they work great, just the same. My callers had no problems whatsoever hearing me on these, and I could hear them beautifully on them as well. I was told that the audio being received from these was loud, crisp, and clear, and the same seemed to be the case for me as well on the other end of the calls. I've also had no trouble using the operational buttons, and my phone found and paired with these headphones easily. The only thing that I didn't remember when I ordered these, though (completely my own fault), is that I won't be able to wear these to take calls while I'm driving, as traffic laws dictate that both ears cannot be covered and obstruct vital traffic sounds. Oh well. My bad.Overall, I am SO thrilled with these headphones. I always found the single-ear Bluetooth headsets to look a little ridiculous, so I was all too eager to get a stereo set of Bluetooth headphones that didn't look odd or awkward. These headphones ARE large, but they're solidly made, and look like an expensive, high quality piece of audio equipment. I love them, and would buy them again in a heartbeat.","5.0","GREAT Bluetooth stereo headphones! I especially look forward to using these when I travel!","1257638400","11 8, 2009"

I am not going to waste any time - what you see is what you get.  It is basically a pretty phone with very good reception, but the outgoing voice quality is below average.

The call quality has been excellent, much like my 2 previous phones from sprint were (Virgin runs off of the Sprint PCS network for those who didn't know). The interface is clean and simple for anyone to use. The volume of the call is loud and clear as is the ringer - I have yet to not hear the phone ringing in my pocket (one of my biggest problems with my last Samsung phone). Virgin has really simple pre-paid pricing plans with a well organized and useful website. Virgin offers lots of ringtones and wallpaper online at 2 bucks a pop as well as celebrity voice mail & rescue ringtones.Now, the badButton size, battery life, built in extras.The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate if you have large hands (Once the phone book is programmed this becomes much less of an issue). This phone will not stay charged for more than 1 day - even if no calls are made. I have to make sure I charge it every night or else it becomes useless - this is my biggest complaint about this phone. There are hardly any backgrounds or ringtones that come with the phone.

"A1YEPFLLH42OU1","B000HJC56G","Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia Yu-Jin Chia","[65, 66]","I'm a long-running Virgin customer, but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry, and so I've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier (including non-US). Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.Let's start with the positives:-Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.-For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.-Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors.-Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage).-UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.-Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.-Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...-Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).On the downside:-Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).-Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.-No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.-No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that.","4.0","Affordable, compact phone","1172793600","03 2, 2007"

"A3A25SCYI0P8CK","B000HZZIGO","T. Lawrence","[2, 2]","I purchased an LG Env3 and I wanted to stay within the LG products category since they made me such an awesome cell phone and TV.  So I did a search for LG stereo headset after I realized my phone did mp3 music and this headset popped up first.  And it showed up first in my search because it deserves to be recognized.  I love this headset.  Even with the stock headphones that come with it I have good loud stereo phone calls and music.  And no, the audio quality with the standard headset is not spectacular, but LG knew that and made it to where you can use your favorite headphones with your cell phone for music.  I owned a Samsung stereo headset to match my SCH-U740 and it did not offer stereo phone calls.  So here are my Pros and Cons for the product as it stands having owned them for 5 months.Pros:+Provides stereo phone calls and music+Goes as loud as you'd like and then some. I couldn't hear one of my friend's on my Jabra BT8040 but I heard him loud and in stereo with this headset+Volume knob on the silver microphone piece for changing the volume on the fly+Price is awesome compared to a bluetooth stereo headset+Reduces drain on your phone battery by keeping bluetooth signal broadcast off+Call button allows you to call the last number (press once), say a voice command (hold button), or hang up the call (press once again) with my Env3+Designed to work with any set of 3.5mm headphones+Has a spring tension clip allowing you to clip it to your clothing or to your seatbelt+Worked as a hands-free calling device through the stereo and speakers in my car! (Details below)+Lightweight. Could be used for running with the right headphones. I did not test this myself though+I can run it underneath my shirt and clip it to my collar to hide the wire. The wire from the 2.5mm end to the control part looks to be about 2 feet long+No complaints about sound quality no matter where I placed it to talk. Including under my sheets and comforter when I went to bedCons (of course)-Low quality headphone included for mp3 playback-The center control is where the weight is so if it isn't clipped to you and you lean over it will pull on the headphones-Does not have wind reduction properties so windy environments may interrupt conversation-The cord from the 2.5mm end to the silver control section is quite long not including added headphone length.  Keeping it discrete outside of clothing would prove difficult-Only way to mute a call is to mute it on the phone.  Cannot mute the headset microphoneThe cons all have to do with the individual.  I love this headset more than any bluetooth I've ever bought.  And I was going to tell you a story about the hands-free headset in my car.  Well, I have one of those tape to 3.5mm headphone jack adapters that works in cars with tape players.  I was on the road and I didn't want the headphones in so I plugged the 3.5mm adapter end into the headset, inserted the tape, turned up the volume, and made a call.  It worked perfectly!  I was able to turn the volume up on the radio and listen to the call through all of my speakers.  The person on the other end told me that the sound was great until the volume in the car was up so loud that his voice was echoing back into the microphone.  But the best part was that the headset wasn't clipped to me, it was in the passengers seat and I was having a conversation without the person asking if something was different.  My next project will be seeing if my radio broadcasting adapter will broadcast my call through my stereo just as well.  I'll try to remember to update when I know for sure.  Trust me, if you're not hung up on being ahead of the technological curve with stereo bluetooth this headset will impress you without a doubt.  Definitely one of the best purchases I will ever make and I can highly recommend it!","5.0","Definitely A Product Worth Owning!","1255132800","10 10, 2009"

"A2E50O4GW1E8GR","B000I8ACMU","Dennis Dennis in NH","[0, 0]","I got a similar case for my Galaxy S3.  Great and useful case.  So I got this one for my Galaxy Note 2.Note: this case is not meant to protect your device from falls, etc. -- it's no Otterbox or rubber bumper case.  In my case, I didn't want a thick protective case because all of them add significant bulk to the phone.  I carry my phone wherever I go and use it in the case on a windshield mount.  With thick cases, I need a bigger windshield mount (or I need to remove the phone from the case -- a big inconvenience) -- with this slim case, the phone fits on the windshield mount while in the case.Removing the Note 2 from this case takes a little effort but you get better at it with practice.The kickstand is very useful for watching videos and/or reading at the table while having coffee or eating, etc.  It's also useful when ussing an external (bluetooth) keyboard.One downside, the case makes it such that the buttons (power and volume up/down) take some effort to &#34;find&#34; without looking.  I need to be able to quickly whip out my phone at a moment's notice without looking at it.  The case as it is, makes it so that finding those buttons requires a little more effort than without the case and/or actually looking at the sides of the phone.  This flaw is NOT entirely the fault of the case -- I never had this problem with the S3 version of this case.  The reason is that the buttons on the Note 2 are slightly more forward so they blend in a lot more with the edge of the case.My solution: I used a small wire cutter to clip off the edged of the case where it connects the openings for where the buttons are.  This did not affect (at least in any discernible way) the structural integrity of the case as the case is pretty stiff.  Also, I clipped of the edges to they were nice and smooth and looked like that's how the case was made.  Now, I can easily &#34;find&#34; the buttons and use the phone as quickly and effectively as without the case.I would absolutely buy this again and on my next phone, I look forward to getting another.","4.0","Slim, textured, with kickstand, looks good, but needed small modification","1388016000","12 26, 2013"

However, after sliding it out multiple times, it becomes loose and is easily removed. My dad was just walking and I guess the holster was slanted downwards a bit and his phone fell out. When it fell out the case came off.

On my previous phone, DROID 3, I also had a holster, which I liked very much. I never grew fond of the idea of putting the phone in my pocket.I bought my holster on 4/26/13 and, despite the many negative reviews, I am pretty sure I have bought the new and improved design. I've had the holster for a little over 2 months at the time of this writing and it's holding up very well. The kickstand is strong, does not feel weak or flimsy, when placing the GN2 inside the case, it snaps in very firmly. as in, you would need like a plastic pry tool to get it out again, and when placing the GN2 into the holster, it fits just fine.So far, there is no dis-colorization (i have the white edition to match the housing of my GN2), the criss-cross pattern isn't fading away, the belt clip is strong and sturdy. I use the belt clip everyday and there are no hints or anything telling me it's going to break any time soon. When the belt clip is in place, it stays there.As stated throughout my review, I don't see any abnormalities by this product.

I actually use it at the gym lifting weights so that I don't have to mess with the arm band. The clip is very solid after a month of use. I'd still recommend buying the other boxwave holster, assuming that it keeps the phone from slipping out.Update: I had to wrap some thread around the claws of the holster to add enough tension to keep the phone in place.I ordered this one, with the weave pattern, because I thought it would help the phone vent heat easier, and because a lot of people at work have the other case design with the softer rubbery feel and the stand.The 3 bad things about it are: 1) the material is very slick and the only thing keeping your phone in the holster is gravity.2) This case does not wrap around the phone, the edges are square. This makes the phone feel a lot wider in your hand than other slim cases.3) is no protection for the bottom of the phone whatsoever. Most slim cases at least have a little wrap around for the bottom edges, this case doesn't even try.The good thing is that it looks like they did put more effort into the belt clip.For the price, I will say it is okay. I will probably add some tacky rubber to the holster rails to keep the phone more firmly in place.

I've owned at least a few different designs of Note 2 holsters now, and I've broken them all by simple actions like accidentally catching the unit on a door jam.This unit has held up better in the past week or so that I've had it (Yup, broke'm in less than a week prior).

"A391KBFZ8DUTPU","B000I8FXYW","B. Kloepfer","[0, 0]","I got this case because it looked moderately protective and it was very cheap. It is pretty protective, and it has protected my phone from a couple of drops. I actually let my friend use it twice and he tossed it about four feet in the air onto very hard carpet and onto the hard floor on a bus. Both times it came out unscathed. I definitely do not think it protects very well though. I do not think it could protect my phone for anything above 4 feet.I would definitely go for the IonicIonic GUARDIAN Armor Case for LG Google Nexus 4 (Black)or the BallisticBallistic SG1098-M005 AGF SG Series Case for LG E960/NEXUS 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Blackcase instead (I just ordered the Ballistic).The grips on the case are not very grippy at all. The 'grippy' part actually seems more slippery in my hands than the non-textured areas. So do not expect to get much more traction on your Nexus 4 with this case.Also, It pulled up my screen protector a lot. I actually ripped it off and cut off the edges a couple of millimetres all around the protector and they cooperate better.Overall, I could not recommend this product because of it's lack of true protection found in the Ballistic and Ionic cases (with three layers and two layer, respectively). Spend a couple more dollars and get an upgrade.","3.0","A good case, but definetly look elsewhere.","1369267200","05 23, 2013"

"A33NCJ04WK9RE","B000I8FXYW","Kevin","[0, 0]","I bought the Artic Red Frost for Nexus 4. i love the material of this case that makes it strong to hold the phone (hard rubber-type material) the case also covers some parts of the bezel-- enough to not damage the screen when laid on its screen. all of the cut-outs are aligned perfectly. two cons for me was it is hard to press the power button & it doesn't have a good grip. Although it was more ease to press the volume buttons, i had to apply more pressure against the power button. Maybe it is a mistake in creating. With about a week, i kind of got used to it, so it did not bother me much to always notice it. Because of the somewhat slippery back, it sorta makes the hold slippery. While i am speaking of the back, the back makes the phone looks awesome. It is transparent and i can clearly read 'nexus' & 'LG' from the back. it gives the phone a good look. The grip, is not a severe issue, but the level of grip is just less than my other case by GreatShield. I just want to put that out there for other consumers to consider. Another thing i'll add is that it looks pretty cool in sunlight. I can see part of the actual phone through the case while the sunlight makes mostly the edges of the case glisten. To conclude, i will be sticking with this case because of the look, protection, and decent grip.","5.0","very nice design with a firm fit for the phone","1394755200","03 14, 2014"

It fits snugly, looks great, covers the buttons (big plus), and isn't so bulky.  While this case is not at all bulky, it still offers protection for the camera lens and screen by having tiny ridges surrounding those parts which keep them from coming into contact with the surface the rest of the phone is resting on.

It clicks shut with two tiny tabs of plastic on either end of the kickstand, so I guess if over time those tabs break then it won't stay shut anymore. But for the moment, the tabs are really tiny and hopefully will not break anytime soon.The only downsides I can find are:a. hard to feel whether or not if you pressed the power/volume button or not, there's no tactile feedback when you push. They do work though.b. the screw(?) that holds the kickstand in place on the back of the case bulges out and makes the phone sit slightly lopsided when you put it on a flat surface facing upward.

"A2HXPG9E2YDM5Y","B000IEB00W","Michael Spanjar boldcopy.com","[0, 0]","It's laughable that people would rate this case lower than four stars. When you spend under $5 for a case designed to fit the latest and greatest smartphone on the planet, you're getting a workaround. That was my intention when I purchased the BoxWave.I had been tempted to buy a folio case. Later, I asked myself why -- why do I need to cover the screen? It's made of Gorilla Glass 3. It's the toughest screen out there and nearly impossible to scratch. Someone said their phone, while in this case, shattered from a two-foot drop. I've seen the GS4 survive multiple drop tests from the top of a ladder onto concrete -- with no case for protection. It's built to take abuse. That's why this case makes sense. In my personal opinion, you need a case like this so you can lay the phone on any flat surface. It raises the screen and the camera lens off your desktop. It also improves the phone's grip in your hand. That's what it's for. And perhaps best of all, it barely adds to the phone's already wide and tall dimensions. If you've got a phone this big, do you really want it any bigger?The buttons are not hard to push, but naturally, because they are covered by the case, they are a little hard-ER to press. Still, if you find it &#34;hard&#34; to push the buttons, maybe what you really need is a little iron in your diet.The TPU material is essentially a hard rubber. Too hard and shiny to keep the phone from sliding on your car's dash, so if you're looking for soft rubber, keep looking. The material itself is naturally on the less-than-premium side, meaning it will build up scratches from constant use. Better that this gets scratched than the GS4's own cheap plastic outer surface. The shiny &#34;X&#34; on the back will pick up finger prints. Not a biggie unless you have a pet peeve about such things.As for fit, the case snaps over the GS4 like a glove - quite perfectly, actually. There is no binding, nor is it at all loose anywhere. I would point out, however, that not all the holes are perfectly aligned. I'm only being picky here. The camera cutout and speaker cutout are the tiniest bit off, not enough to make a difference, other than I notice it. The headphone and micro USB ports are wide open, so there are no problems plugging cords in.Get it as your primary case, or get it as a spare to give your phone a new look every once in a while. Either way, you know what you're getting.","4.0","What you'd expect for the price","1372636800","07 1, 2013"

It's really god that you can still see the samsung logo on the back thanks to the frosted plastic semi-transparent design but it doesn't get scrached up easily like a completely clear case.So, now for the important bit, cases are supposed to protrect your phone and this case definitely does that and it does it quite well. The one-piece hybrid design provides a very good protection to the frame against drops and the lay on thr table desgin also provides screen protection.Port access is good, I had no problem using the original Samsung equipment and a couple of other headphones.The ONLY drawback for me. Power and volume buttons don't provide a great tactile feedback when pressed with this case so this is why I'll shave a star from the rating.","4.0","Very good case.","1390348800","01 22, 2014"

"A1M0DWDX09QYHR","B000IEB00W","Ricardo Valdes","[15, 19]","This review is for the BoxWave case with stand. The reason I have to say that is because BoxWave has NINE different cases on this one listing! I could understand if the &#8220;Size&#8221; option was for different models of phones, but to have be different CASES is just misleading, and probably saves BoxWave money on listing fees.As for the actual case&#8230; I bought this because it was one of the &#8220;Best Cases&#8221; for the s4 as per Cnet. I don&#8217;t know what the deal is, however this case is pure garbage! The cutout for the bottom microphone is so off-center that the microphone is actually covered! As a result, I sounded muffled to the person on the other end of the line. The cutout for the camera is the same way. For normal pictures, it is OK as it case does not block the lens, however it does partially cover the flash. As a result, you get glare on the bottom of the photo from the flash.The Kickstand is useless. There is nothing to lock it in place, so the phone falls over unless you balance it &#8220;just right.&#8221; Even then, once you tap the screen (ie: skip a You Tube add), the phone falls over. Also the hinge on the back of the phone causes the phone not to lay flat.I paid $4 for this case, and I got the type of quality one would expect for a $4 case. I WOULD NOT suggest this case if you are looking for a Kickstand case. Other cases on this listing &#8220;might&#8221; be a better quality case, however, I would not hold my breath. To be honest, the cheap quality of the case I received, and the deceptive nature of the listing, I WILL NOT buy another BoxWave case.","1.0","Got what I paid for","1377734400","08 29, 2013"

"A3223W5IROMYTY","B000IEDI66","MOAR COARS","[36, 43]","I have had the Galaxy S4 for a few weeks now and I have decided to buy a cheap case to protect it from scratching and cracking the screen.  I was a little skeptical at first when purchasing this case because I wasn't sure it would satisfy me. Before purchasing this case, I looked on Amazon to see what other cases there were and all of them were sort of expensive and I just wanted something that would get the job done while not being too expensive and this was the best case I could find.After getting the case, I can safely say that there's no other case out there that can beat this case in price. If anybody out there is not sure what case to get that will keep their Galaxy S4 protected then you have found the one. This case makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand and doesn't add much bulk to the phone. It fits perfectly with the phone. One little thing that bothers me is that the buttons (power and volume) are a little hard to press but other than that, it's hard to beat the price of this case.Pros:+ Makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand+ Doesn't add much bulk to the phone+ Fits the phone perfectly+ CheapCons:- The power and volume buttons are a little hard to pressOverall I am happy with the purchase I made and I'm enjoying this case. I am always very careful with my phones and rarely ever drop them. I don't need an expensive case but just one that will do the job. I hate having scratches on the back of the phone or cracks on the screen. I recommend this case to anyone who's looking for a cheap case that will protect their phones without spending much money on an expensive case.","5.0","Can't Beat This Price!","1369958400","05 31, 2013"
"A2EQH150G63PDS","B000IEDI66","Nicholi2789","[10, 12]","Let me start off by saying, like so many others reviewing this fabulous product. I bought this case just to tide me over until I could find a better higher quality one. I already have an Otterbox Commuter, but I like to have several cases. One that provides the most protection for when I'm at work, and others that are smaller and don't add so much bulk. Plus, I am somewhat of a case-whore. I had 12 cases for my S3.I thought this case would be a suitable temporary case until I could find another one. I was wrong. This is just a good case period!Like I said, I prefer slim fitting cases so as not to detract from the over-all slimness of this device. I also prefer the soft gel feel of these types of cases to the hard plastic of others. I find it provides better shock absorbancy and just feels better overall.This is the highest quality case I have ever bought for $1.75 ($4.25 shipped).Service-I ordered this on a Sunday night, and paid the minimum shipping price. I fully expected that it wouldn't show up for a week at least (the fourth of July was the following thursday). When I got my confirmation email from Amazon they said that estimated arrival date would be the 6th-9th. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to find the case waiting for me in my mailbox Wednesday afternoon. Took two days to get here. Very nice.Quality-As I said before, I am very impressed with the quality of this case for the price. It is the soft gel feeling plastic, with a glossy finish on the sides and top and a matte black grippy finish on the back. The back is nice because when you set it on your dash board it doesn't try to slide off. You can't really see it in the pictures but it's there and very noticable in person (but not in a bad way).Needless to say, this case is a very tight fit on the phone, and everything lines up perfectly. I've noticed that sometimes on these kinds of cases that cutout for the charging port won't be quite large enough and the usb cable won't plug in all the way. That's just  the trouble with these plastic molds sometimes. That is not the case here. Perfect fit. ALL the ports are perfectly cutout.As for the power and volume buttons, instead of being covered and thus harder to press they are cutout as well. They also fit perfectly and are not hard to press at all. That camera and speaker cutout is perfect as well.This case fits the phone so perfectly it's unbelievable. Its not so tight as to be hard to get off and on but it is snug. Sometimes when I'm peeling it off it will try to take the battery cover too, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion.Conclusion-Once again this case is the highest quality case I have ever bought for this low of a price. It keeps the phone slim but also provides the needed protection that you bought it for. Awesome, awesome case. I plan on checking out more products by this company.Overall, for less than five dollars out the door you will not find a higher quality case for your shiny new Galaxy S4.","5.0","Amazing case for the price.

The grip is superb...your phone will never feel like it's slipping from your hand, and it's slim-fit and matte' finished back will preserve the slender form factor of your elegant Galaxy S4, and with none of the bulk of the multi-layer 'body armor cases' on the market. It doesn't offer the 'bomb proof' protection of an Otterbox Defender, but it doesn't claim to.It's a simple, elegant, but protective case that unless you're James Bond should suit your needs perfectly.On the other hand, 007 has always been style conscious. So yeah, I think he'd like one, too!UPDATE: I've been using this case with my Samsung Galaxy S4 for just over a week, now, and would like to revise my opinion of it.

I loved this case so much that I bought another to replace my old one. (long story on how but it wasn't the case's fault)The Samsung Note is a big phone, but I didn't want to make it any bigger. A lot of case will make the phone bigger than what it is. But I didn't like the phone without a case because it is very slippery. This case fits perfectly and gave you a nice grip to hold the phone. It didn't make the phone that much bigger either.The case also had a nice bumper on it so if you dropped the phone it will take some of the impact. Also if you drop it facing down on the screen, it will prevent it from getting scratched.The only drawback to the case is the white rim around the edge won't stay white.

My cell-phone was too old and could only be used to make phone calls..Then, I finally upgraded my cell-phone.So now all I needed to enjoy music from my phone was a USB cable to connect my Nokia to my old Compaq computer(the computer upgrade would come only recently).I first decided to order a no-name USB compatible cable, big mistake. So I went back and ordered the Nokia OEM CA-53 USB data cable, great choice!I've had the cable for about a year now and overall, it works great. The cable material itself feels much better than the generic brand I bought. For the most part, the music that I rip from my CD's are transfered flawlessly to my Nokia phone.The only minor complaint I have is that sometimes the physical connection between the USB cable and my Nokia phone is a little too easily knocked-off. So I have to take care not to touch the phone at all while data is being transfered.Overall this is a solid choice that I definately recommend for your Nokia phone.","5.0","No more CD Walkman!","1222387200","09 26, 2008"

I have the zboost sitting right beside the laptop so I cannot speak for range. I haven't tried it with my cell phone but its bars went up, too.

"A2RG1B0K8YBJ4A","B000J2XZ1K","Mac Coder","[0, 1]","When installed according to instructions, this unit fulfills all its claims.NOTE that for the best success, you should separate the external antenna and internal base unit by as much distance and signal-obstruction as possible -- put the outdoor antenna at at the best available signal location, and the indoor base unit in the worst dead-zone.  Use every inch of the 50' cable supplied.My installation is in a steel-framed and steel-skinned building -- getting a signal inside was basically impossible. The outside antenna is on an old TV antenna mast 5' above the building roof, and the inside unit is sitting on top of a suspended ceiling in the center of the main area. Now I get 5-bars on Sprint anywhere inside the building, and 3-4 bars within 10 feet or so of the building outside. Our ATT data card gets a 5-bars signal also. (We are thus using both bands on this unit at once.)While not cheap, it is the least expensive alternative available, and It Just Works(tm).","5.0","Does what it claims, quite nicely.","1244678400","06 11, 2009"
"A12R93JEX6C435","B000J2XZ1K","M. Klein mike_in_ca","[7, 7]","Knowing the wide range of reviews of this product, I ordered it anyway and would return it if it really didn't work out.Here's the summary: I spent much of two days trying every possible combination of signal antenna location: inside, outside, 10 feet high, 20 feet high, near a window, in the attic.  I followed the instructions and kept the base unit as far away as possible, with as much vertical separation as possible.  I oriented the base station antenna vertically and horizontally.Nothing worked.  I called Wi-Ex technical support and their recommendation was to buy the additional directional antenna and aim it at one specific tower.  I decided I didn't want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work, so I returned it instead.Now the detail.  I did quite a bit of background work.  I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around.  My house is a single-story wood frame; no big buildings around and no hills.  There are 3 AT&T; cell towers within 0.85 miles (I found them and measured distance).  The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers, and apparently their power is adjusted so that they don't overlap a great deal.  In other words, I get three sets of signals, none particularly strong, and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random.  So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal, and rarely gets one very strong for very long.The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna, in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly.  It will simply repeat that mixed up signal.  Furthermore, the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal, which happens every once in a while.  So it is easy to see what is happening.  The repeater cannot help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting  boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal.  The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better, just different -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without, but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away.  Beyond that, I lost signal.The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower.  This would potentially solve these issues: the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength (I think).  However, I'm not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research.I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510.  I will want to look at other options (all of which, BTW, are substantially more expensive, but generally the companies offering them have longer track records).The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single, dominant cell tower nearby.  In my case, with multiple equal-strength towers (but at marginal strength), it did not help at all.  Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation, it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are.  The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work.  RF just isn't like that.Thanks to Amazon, returning it was easy.","2.0","Results will vary","1270080000","04 1, 2010"
"A38R7G4PREOMLE","B000J2XZ1K","R. Petersen","[0, 0]","We bought this unit about a year ago and it helped.  We live way out in the sticks and are probably 3-5 miles (as the crow flies) from the cell tower.  Before setting up the booster we were lucky to get any service in the house.  Afterwards we could get 2 or 3 bars, but had to stay fairly close to the base unit.  Recently I added the dual-band directional antenna and our signal strength on both of our iPhone4's is maxed out at 5 bars throughout most of the house.  This product is worth the money as long as you remember to also purchase the directional antenna if you are in a far fringe area.  Adding the external antenna seems to increase the range of the base unit.Update (09-13-10): I have found one complaint.  So far I am on my third OEM power supply.  The little power block died at about the same time as a lightning storm went through and made our house power hiccup so I'm not sure what knocked out the block (yes, it IS on a surge protector).  I bought a variable DC power supply as a backup since I could not find a generic power supply that would work (3.6VDC, 2.0A). I also added a grounding wire on my outdoor antenna.  Since then I haven't had a problem.  All I am saying is I wish they would include a little more robust power supply with this unit.  I still think the unit is worth it, just think about an additional power supply if you are susceptible to power failures, lightning strikes or both.","4.0","Does what it's supposed to","1274659200","05 24, 2010"

"A24WWXVEQ6F64O","B000JD09P4","BeachBunny","[18, 19]","I have two of these chargers and have bought a few others for colleagues and we've all been rather impressed with them.  They're reasonably well-built and work.  I didn't have any of the quality control issues that one reviewer had with the battery terminals.  I normally use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable AA batteries with mine and haven't had a problem with connections.  I use it to charge my PDA, personal Motorola Razr phone, and corporate Blackberry. (Thank you God for whoever decided to finally standardize some devices with the mini-USB connector!)  It does seem to take about 1-2 hrs to charge up the devices, which is as long as it normally takes when they're connected to their native chargers.These units ARE picky about battery voltages. If the AA batteries are partially discharged, it might not see them.  In terms of battery usage, using regular rechargables, you can expect to get one full charge on your phone from the batteries because of the high voltage requirement of the charger to start up.  There'll still be juice left in the AA's, but good luck getting the little chip inside these chargers to wake up.What would I like to change?  1) The very high low-voltage cutoff.  Chances are you're using these in an emergency situation when power isn't available or nearby.  These are the times when you want EVERY last ounce of power, even if it's only 5 minutes worth of charging time.  2) The charging tips are detatchable and are too easy to lose and a longer cord would be appreciated, especially when trying to talk on the phone and charge.  3) A different battery door design.  The current design is solid, but can be a bit challenging to replace the door after changing batteries.Overall, a little gadget no road warrior should be without.  Its shortcomings are minor compared to the functionality it provides.","5.0","Great little device","1191801600","10 8, 2007"

"A4391PDC1HCB6","B000JHKU72","Bruce Whitehead","[1, 2]","Finally, after 4 tries, I have found a set of bluetooth wireless headphones that I can actually live with.Are they perfect - NO!  I'll get into the pros and cons below, but first I've got to say that when I started my quest to purchase a decent sounding, less than a 100 lbs, and less than a fortune set of wireless headphone, I did not expect it to be this difficult.For my music source I purchased the Verizon ENV2, and added an 8 GB chip.I first ordered the JBL 610 ($125). While they paired up perfectly, they sounded much too tinny and felt cheap. Return # 1.Next I ordered the top-of-the line Sony DRBT50 ($165). These were light weight, felt great, and when I got stereo, they sounded wonderful. Unfortunately, they would not stay in stereo mode, kept reverting back to mono. Also, the controls were badly placed and I kept hitting the controls when I put them on. Return # 2.Next came the Jabra BT8030 ($137). They paired easily and sounded very nice (they have chip enhanced bass). Also - they turn into stand-alone speakers and they really sound great in that mode. The sound level actually doubles. Unfortunately, they weighted about a ton and I felt really stupid when I walked around the mall with them on. Oh yea, the ad claimed 32 hours of use between charges, but once I got them the specs said 7-8 hours. Big difference. I thought about keeping them for the stand-alone stereo - but - back they went. Return # 3.That's when I gave up and bought a pair of Bose wired headphone (the cheap $150 pair). They sounded great and lightweight - but once I got them on the plane I remembered why I wanted wireless phones. I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off. So after a couple of weeks of this, I decided to try one more time. I kept the Bose for the office.I purchased the Motorola S805, basically out of sheer desperation. They were only $88 at Amazon (I love Amazon!), and free shipping, so I gave them a try. Surprisingly, they paired easily and sounded really good.  They were not especially light weight, but fit fine on my head and were not all that heavy (8 oz). No glitches the first 3 days, then all at once I went to turn them off, and they went in pairing mode and the only way to get them out was to plug in the charger. A couple of more days went by and one morning they would not turn on (had plenty of charge). So I decided they were defective, and I sent them back and got a replacement pair. After about 3 days with the replacement set, once again they went into pairing mode, and then later would not turn on. Hum, if it happened the same way twice, then it probably was not a defect but something I was doing wrong. So I experimented with them for a few days and figured it out. Here goes: If you follow the instructions when turning them off and wait until after all 3 flashing lights before releasing the on/off button, they will go into pairing mode. If you release the button as soon as the first flash happens, they turn off. A quirk, but, given my history and desperation, not all that hard to live with. Next, why would they not turn on sometimes? I found this one by accident. I went to turn off the headphones, but forgot to first press the music play/stop button, just turned off the phones. That did it, they would not turn back on until I plugged in the charger and reset them. Okay, for most people that would be enough to send them back but I really want wireless headphones so I am keeping them.A few other observations:(1) I tested the charge time and so far they've gone 16 hours on a single charge, and they were still working. They are rated at 17 hours. Charge takes almost exactly 3 hours.(2) A big pro is the case, hard shell and very nice. Room to store the charger and supplied wired cable.(3) They transition seemlessly from stereo headphones to hands-free phone headset. When you hear the ring tone, just press the Phone button and you are talking. Clear as a bell. Not sure how my voice is coming through, but have not received any complaints so I assume it is clear as well. When you are finished with your call, press the phone button again, and you are back to music in a couple of seconds. The music is paused so you don't miss a note.(4) The ad says they reduce noise and echo, but I did not find either of these to be true. Background noise is not noticably reduced, and there is a noticable echo when walking in the mall. Does not really bother me, but you should be aware of this. Haven't tried them on the plane yet.(5) Controls: I like the placement of the controls. Took me only a couiple of days be become an expert at lowering or raising the music volume (a wheel), skipping or repeating a song (a different wheel), pausing (quick push of a button), or answering the phone (quick push of a differnt button).Okay, that's about it. I will keep them and I do recommend them if you don't mind dealing with a quirk or two. Besides, $88 (now $79 I see) isn't all that much money to be the first on your block to own some new high-tech gadget.","4.0","Forth Time's A Charm","1215907200","07 13, 2008"

Maxon","[2, 3]","My purpose for buying the S805 headphones was to hook them up to my Home Theater so that I could watch movies, hear the PS3, and listen to music all in one place.Most of the other reviews cover the product fairly well, so I will mention the one thing that made a difference for me: the Bluetooth transmitter.I had the Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s) and figured since my Motorola S9 Headphones worked fine with it; then these Motorola S805 headphones should work fine as well. I was wrong. After spending close to an hour of transfers, hang ups, and poor English, I finally got an answer from someone at Motorola's support line: The S805 is not compatible with your transmitter. I asked them in return, do you sell a transmitter that will work with them? for which their reply was, Only one that works with an iPod.So, I had to find another alternative. Someone here at Amazon mentioned in their review that they used the Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) with success. I broke down and ordered this, investing more than I had intended, but was pleased to find that the Motorola S805 headphones indeed work with this Sony Transmitter. I haven't used it much to do further testing, but it seems to work fine at close range; walking out of the room cuts the signal in and out, and if it totally drops you have to re-sync it. But I'm usually sitting on the couch, less than 10 feet away, and so far it works like a charm.So to sum-up:1) Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s) = does not work with the Motorola S8052) Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) = does work with the Motorola S805If there are others, I'm not aware of them.Other things to note on transmitters:1) My Bluetooth dongle on the computer did not connect these headphones either. My understanding is that you must have an A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) compatible dongle for it to work.2) The PS3 may have connected the device, but I didn't try as after some research, I learned that the system does not play game sounds and music through the Bluetooth connection. It is only good for talking back and forth with other gamers. Hopefully Sony adds this feature in the future.","4.0","Using with a Bluetooth transmitter","1231286400","01 7, 2009"

Motorola used the horrible one button does it all interface for operating power and pairing, even though there are two buttons on the headset.* The other button on the other side of the headset is useless because it's proprietary.  It's supposed to pause/play music but it doesn't work with any device I've ever paired the headphones with.* The little rubber flap that covers the USB and audio input plugs is always falling out and hanging lopsided.* The headphones say on the package and in adverts that you can connect a headphone cable to another device to listen instead of using Bluetooth, but they don't tell you that the cable has to be Motorola's special headphone cable, which you have to order from Motorola.  You can't just go to the store and buy a iPod headphone cable to use with the headphones like you can with most other devices.*The fabric on the inside of the headband is nice for keeping your head from sweating but it causes carpet burns on the back of your neck if you wear the headphones around your neck.*Not recommended for DJs (trust me, I am one) because you can never be sure how long the battery is going to last, as there's no battery meter. You really don't want your headphones to quit on you in the middle of a live show.* When the batteries get low there's a series of three beeps then an ear-bursting *POP* noise.  I wrote to Motorola to complain and ask if the issue could be fixed, but they responded by sending me another set of the same headphones which had the same problem. The only workaround is to quickly jerk the headphones off of your head when you hear the three beeps to avoid hurting your ears with the loud pop noise.* There's a really bright LED light that fades on and off while the headphones are receiving audio that you can't disable, on each side of the headphones.  It's kind of neat for about the first five minutes then it gets annoying.* The minimum volume is still sometimes too loud.* Default volume at power on is always too loud.","3.0","Good Sound Difficult to Operate","1212624000","06 5, 2008"

After reading some of the reviews, I thought it wouldn't be such a bad buy considering the price. As the title says, these headphones do not work well with a Macbook Pro. Sure it will connect and everything, but the bluetooth setup that apple has on these laptops suck. I mean, the sound has a lot of static and cuts out. I'm not sure if its OSX that's the problem or the bluetooth radio but all I know is that the sound coming from the headphones just did not sound nice. At this point I wondered if it was the headphones or the computer. So I switched to my Compaq running Windows XP and lo and behold it sounded incredible. No static, no cutouts, nothing. The sound was crisp on both bass and treble songs. It was easy to connect and was running A2DP. I can bet that most people who rated these headphones poorly either had a non A2DP compatible source or was using a Macbook Pro. So even though I enjoy my Mac, all I can say is that apple skimps out on small things like bluetooth and to some people that means a lot. Overall the headphones were comfortable and felt very solid. The charge time is long (3 hours), but is definitely worth it. I have yet to try these with a A2DP cellphone so sorry if I don't review call quality and such. Even with my problem with my Macbook Pro, I thought that it wasn't the headphone quality that affected the sound, it was the computer and that shouldn't affect the overall rating of the headphones, so I rated these 5 stars.Pros:Cheap!Sound is impressive on both treble and bass.

Sure, I can hear through them and I can speak and others hear me but it's they're not problem-free by any stretch of the imagination. But, I keep searching.I was first drawn to this because it's red. I'll be honest. Then I realized that it was small. And then, inexpensive. So I bought it to use with my iPhone.I've been using it for about five weeks as of this review. It's super easy to pair, it fits nicely in my ear and to date, has not fallen out once. The charger is a neat little case which for some reason, I like.I find that I often have to turn the volume down on the headset because it's just too loud even while driving with the windows down. People I talk to have said that they don't even notice that I'm using a headset which is important to me. I hate when people use headsets that make them sound far away or like they're standing in a silo. One time I was standing outside and it was getting ready to storm and the wind was blowing like crazy. My friend did say he couldn't hear me well with the wind blowing that hard into the microphone. Makes sense.That's been the only trouble though. Oh, and the thing is so small it's easy to lose in a purse for sure and easy to forget when you put it in your front jeans pocket.

(The one exception I'll explain) First of all it's super light and fits so well that you'll forget it's in your ear. Really! It feels so snug that it doesn't feel like it might fall out, unlike many others. (Forget that optional ear loop thing. It made it worse.) Second, when it needs recharging there's no need for plugging and unplugging wires. Just set it in it's case and close the lid. Take it out when it's done. (The case stays plugged in. No messing with the wire.) Third and most important to me is the sound quality. I compared these 8 headsets: Plantronics Voyager 510, Plantronics Explorer 320, Jabra BT8040, Jabra BT500, Motorola HS850, Motorola H700, Jawbone, Samsung WEP200. I compared them head-to-head by pairing two at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them while on the same call. This lets me and the caller compare the sound quality for both of us. I do this in a few different environments with a few different background sounds. This puppy sounded clearer than all the others except one and specifically in one situation. Here's the exception: loud background noise. Now hear me out, I work in construction and background noise is a huge issue for me at work. I've never found any headset that handles background noise better than the Plantronics Voyager 510. Not the Jawbone or anything else. So for me the Samsung WEP200 won't work. Mostly because of the background noise, but also because it's cute red color would make me stand out like a bullseye at a firing range. But, it's not for me! It's for my mom and she loves it! (and she won't be doing construction anytime soon) So if you don't have a noisy environment then I give this an A+. Yes, it sounds hollow in a car. Yes, if the wind blows straight into it the caller can't hear you. But I haven't found one that doesn't do that, and this has clearer sound than all of them. (With my one exception) Oh, one more thing. It has 4 hours of talk time which is less than the others (they range from 6-12), so if you talk a lot, for the price you can buy two. Charge and pair them both and you'll have a spare.","5.0","Love it! Better sound than 7 others I tested,","1205020800","03 9, 2008"

Once I opened it up, I noticed there only one microphone inside.  With only one microphone, it can not do noise cancellation.  I also noticed the speaker is quit small.  I think if I can find a long microphone wire to wire the microphone to somewhere facing the driver mouth and replace the speaker with a larger one, it might work well.  Of source I have to disable the internal 4V lithium ion battery to let car battery provide the power, so that when car power off, it will stop working. I need to insert a small delay circuit, so that when car powering on, it will turn on the T305.I wish Motorola making the modification for it, that will make people's life a lot easier:1) make the bluetooth car kit powering on when USB power is on and powering off when USB power is off;2) Make a microphone jack so that user can extend the microphone wire to somewhere they like microphone to be.For under $30, this is a very good device. I would get this instead of in-ear bluethooth device. I lost too many bluetooth device hang on my ear.  I installed one of the Motorola higher end bluetooth car kit in one of our cars.  That one works well, but installation was a lot of work.

I was tempted to purchase a Sony Ericsson HCB-100 since I have a Sony Ericsson K790A, but opted not to because it was half-duplex and I would have to order it. I wanted a full duplex speakerphone that could be purchased from a brick and mortar store in case I wanted to return it because it sucked that bad.Despite reading the poor reviews here, I took a calculated risk in purchasing the T305 from a local Best Buy. Calculated as in I was banking on Motorola's reputation to not steer me wrong.It has been a day so far and I can say that I am satisfied. I can hear the caller clearly, vice versa. My girlfriend event commented how I sounded better than my Plantronics 640 headseat. It makes me wonder about the poor reviews in that regard. My SWAG is that the phone and bluetooth connection makes up 50% of the whole. If the phone is crappy or the bluetooth connection is flaky, then of course it is going to suck. Of course, it is also inevitable for lemons to get past manufacturing QA.The reason why I gave it a 4-stars and not a 5 is because of the other negatives that have been mentioned already:1- big blinking blue light, but that's trivial because I can tune it out like I tune out my girlfriend;2- no wall charger, but that's also trivial because I already have at least a couple mini-USB chargers from other devices I have;3- I can not get the voice dialing working, but that's ok because I bought the car kit to answer calls, not make them.It may seem like I am justifying the negatives, but ultimately they really do not bother me such that it is a deal breaker.

"A1N5FSCYN4796F","B000JKKE5M","Philip R. Heath Gadgets, Music, & Books","[445, 448]","I was looking for a replacement for my bluetooth headset when I started looking at bluetooth speakerphones.  After doing some research, I was looking for the following:* No installation - I wanted to use it in multiple vehicles/locations* Reasonable price* Trusted brand* Good sound quality* Easy to useI am happy to report that the T305 does a good (sometimes great) job of satisfying my requirements.  Here's a look at how it has performed:Setup - Upon opening the box, there are really two things to do:  insert the visor clip which is easily secured and use the car charger that comes with the unit.  While the instructions said that charging could take up to two hours, my unit fully charged in about 30 minutes.  Once complete, simply power on the device, and it automatically enters pairing mode.  I was able to find it with my LG VX-9900 (see my review) with no problems at all.Use - Coming from a background of using headsets, I must say that I cannot imagine going back.  I really like not having anything hanging on my ear (and sometimes inserted in my ear depending on the headset).  This model also seems geared toward the people who use headsets because the operation is very similar.  One nice thing is that the power button is separate from the multi-function button.  With my 9900, I am able to initiate voice dialing from the speakerphone and with the 9900 set to auto-answer, calls are automatically transferred after 2 seconds.  The volume controls on the sides are easily accessible and operate similar to most headsets.  I never have to touch my phone at all so it truly is hands-free.Call Quality - All of the above is meaningless if the calls don't sound good, right?  Well, have no fear.  The call quality for both parties is better than any headset that I have ever used - and I've used six different ones over last 2 years.  Some of this has to do with positioning.  In the Texas heat, most people have their AC on a high setting.  Unfortunately, most headsets are positioned directly in line with the air flow.  However with a visor clip-on of this speakerphone, this is not the case.  Add to that the noise canceling technology, and the people on the other end hardly know that they are on speakerphone at all.  On my end, the volume is more than adequate.  It's really a simple matter of physics - the speaker is bigger here than it is on a headset.Cons - So what's the catch?  As I mentioned earlier, the device only ships with a car charger.  I ordered (rather cheaply) a wall charger to compensate for this.  While it was annoying, it wasn't the end of the world.  Others have mentioned the flashing blue light.  I have to admit that the first time I was driving in the dark, it was initially distracting.  However, I got used to it rather quickly, and I don't notice it anymore.  I would compare it to getting a new car that has a loud turn signal.  You notice it a lot at first, but you learn to tune it out.  Also, it does not have a display, but then again, neither do headsets.  Finally, I use it in a similar manner to a headset.  I take it with me when I get out of the car, and I power it off between uses.  It's not an integrated speakerphone so it isn't tied to your car's power supply like more sophisticated (and expensive) models.  None of these are deal-breakers for me.Bottom line - If you are looking for a good alternative to bluetooth headsets, and you intended use pattern will be similar to that of a headset, then this is what you are looking for.  It has great quality, and it's easy to use.","4.0","Tired Of Bluetooth Headsets?  Here's An Alternative","1192665600","10 18, 2007"

Basically perfect except for my cons..Cons:  Huge blinking blue light is annoying at night and invisible during the day.  Sometimes it take a second for it to answer a call when you click the answer button.  I guess the solution for that is probably to wait a few seconds after answering before saying hello.  This flaw also demonstrates itself when using VZ Navigator, because it cuts off the first word of driving instructions.  This flaw might be from my MOTOKRZR phone and not from the T305, but I don't have any way to know which end causes it.Another reviewer stated that the on/off button is too small.  When I first read that, I didn't know why it matters.  I now know.  At least with a MOTOKRZR (and I'd assume other phones), the speaker on your phone will be inactive when it is connected via Bluetooth to your T305.  With 150 feet of range, it actually stays connected if you are 150 feet from your car.  Therefore you have to turn it off every time you get out of the car, or else you won't be able to hear calls you receive on your phone.  It isn't a huge deal, and something you can get used to, but Motorola should have either made the on/off button more accessible or cut the Bluetooth range down to about 15 feet.Overall the best handsfree solution for talking in the car.

"A3NEAETOSXDBOM","B000JKKE5M","Stephen M. Charme","[1, 1]","I was looking for a no frills car speaker to use with my BlackBerry Tour that was easily portable between different cars, easy to use, and had good sound quality for speaking and listening. The T305 did the trick.Pairing this with my Tour was quick and effortless. Using it is a breeze. I just hit the phone button to receive a call and my speed dial buttons to dial frequently called numbers. Voice activated calling also works, though I tend not to use that.This is a small unit that clips unobtrusively and easily to the visor for easy installation and removal. The people I call say that my voice is clearer than when I was using a headset. I can also hear them more clearly.Let me address some critiques mentioned in other reviews, none of which should deter you from buying this unit:1. There is no AC charger, only a cigarette lighter charger with a micro USB plug on one end. True, but there are lots of gadgets you can buy to power electronic gadgets via a USB cable and AC outlet (I own several; one of my favorites is the Tekkeon MP-1800, which I use for this unit as well as my iPod Touch, Tour, and Slacker G2).Also, if you have a USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B cable (which costs only a few dollars on Amazon) you can charge this unit via the USB port on your computer.2. The power switch is tiny. True, but it really is not difficult to turn this on and off (and it shuts off automatically after 30 minutes when not paired with your phone, which happens when you leave the car and get far enough away).3. There is a flashing blue light to indicate that the unit is connected to the phone (and my Tour also has a flashing blue light while it is connected to the speaker). True, but if it bothers you just put a piece of black electrical tape over it (though I would not cover it completely so that when you charge this unit, you can tell when the charging light turns from red to blue to indicate a full charge).4. The unit does not automatically turn on and sync with your phone when you get into the car. True, but it is not really a big deal to turn it on.Bottom line: This unit cost less than half the sale price of my fancy blue tooth headset and is both easier and clearer for me to use. In addition, since pairing with a phone is required only once, you can use this with multiple phones (though obviously not at the same time), which is handy when my wife wants to borrow it for occasional use. The only adjustment on this unit is the volume, but that is all that I was looking for. For a plain vanilla unit I recommend this.Update April 7, 2010: I now place this unit next to the center console so that I can connect it via a USB cable to a charging unit by my console that I use for my electronic gadgets, which keeps this unit charged all the time. The sound quality is still fine (I made a test call to my home answering machine). I also like not having this unit visible on my visor lest someone mistake it for a GPS and break into my car to steal it.","5.0","Excellent product","1268870400","03 18, 2010"

The E51 is nearly twice the price now but 10 times the phone (GSM quad band, WCDMA dual band, 802.11g an FM radio and god knows what else that I haven't found yet). I have temporarily given the KRZR to my significant other, but I'll be replacing that and the daughter's phones with Nokia phones when we change the plan to use the E51's data capabilities; why would I inflict on her what I wasn't happy with myself?Let's do the good first: The voice quality in both directions is good, the talk time is good and the standby time is good enough that I am surprised when it needs recharging. I use it quite a lot and that still only seems to be twice a week. The ring tones are the usual selection but the maximum volume is considerably higher than in my old phone. Signal handling is much better, it holds on to calls that AT&T; could previously be relied on to drop, but there are still issues where it fails to roam to the next cell, though I strongly suspect that is due to lame network software rather than the phone (symptoms are that after a dropped call with no signal the signal strength immediately maxes out). For someone who travels to Europe the quad band GSM is indispensable, I keep a spare SIM for UK visits because it gives me calls to the US for about 1/10th of the cost of allowing AT&T; to roam to Europe. The music player is fine, but you are going to have to either buy bluetooth headphones, which you can't use on a plane, or buy the USB adapter which should have been included for the trivial cost in such an expensive phone. It makes an excellent alarm clock and is loud as hell.The not so good: The iTap text entry is slow and not as good as the old version, whatever that was called. I guess I'll eventually get used to iTap, but the old predictive text had some advantages.The Ugly: the joker who came up with these side buttons that can't be disabled should be fired. It's the easiest thing in the world to brush against the phone and fire up the crummy voice entry (below) or, with a bit more of a rubbing motion, switch the ringer from one more to another. So you can silence the phone and drop it in your pocket only to find it ringing in the middle of a movie. Or you eventually notice nobody is talking to you and check the phone only to find you have a couple of missed calls and the phone has been set to silent. Somehow. Then there's the voice entry, the best you could say is that it's not good. If you brush against the voice button it thinks about it for a good while and then some awful woman say say a command. Now you have to try and convince it to call someone based on the phone's attempt at pronouncing the name you used in the phone book. Since I work with a load of Indians and Chinese that's about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. It was much more useful to be able to program the nicknames.But would I buy it again? Yes. There aren't many neat phones like this and if there's another one with quad band GSM too I didn't find it.But if someone comes out with a quad band GSM phone with good signal handling and no side buttons you'll see my KRZR on Ebay the next day.","4.0","Pretty good phone with standard Motorola issues","1185062400","07 22, 2007"

We are not ready to pay Verizon $50 per phone per month to just sync up the phone book.In this Internet age, you would think any technology company would put all their support materials and drivers on the Internet for people to download.

My initial impression was this phone was very tiny. It is smaller than the RAZR V3 in overall dimensions. I use this unlocked phone with Cingular in the Los Angeles area.The good:1)Small and cool looking. Most people who have seen it seems to be enamored with its design and form factor. It is definitely an eye catcher.2)Call quality is great. The volume can be turned on VERY loud. So if you are hard of hearing or just like to hear loud voices over the phone, then this phone will probably fit the bill.3)Speaker phone. Motorola managed to incorporate a great pair of speaker phones. It is loud and clear enough to have a conference call in a small room full of people.4)Comes with more than basic ring tones. It comes with several (around 12) musical ring tones. Better yet, the ring tones comes out in a full stereo mode (or at least sounds like it).5)Camera is good (2MP). Although it will not replace your digicam, it will be more than adequate for emergency uses.6)Battery life. My informal test on this is that it can handle upto 4-5 hours of talk time.The Bad (mostly due to it is unlocked):1)You need to configure EVERYTHING on the phone. Nothing comes preconfigured. This includes the default language, time, date, voicemail, email, IM etc. This can get rather tedious since Cingular does not support unlocked phones.2)You may lose some functionalities. For example, I have noticed my web browser functionalities do not work with my cingular SIM card.

I started carrying my cord to recharge my phone, but I need an outlet for that, and my car's cigarette lighter outlet never worked.One night after work, I got in my car in the back corner of the dark parking lot only to find a dead car battery. I had left the lights on all day. Sound familiar? I didn't have my jumper cables with me (boyfriend had them), and my boyfriend was out of town. I have no family in town. No one was in sight in this bad part of town. I locked myself in and pulled out my phone to call my roadside assistance. It began to beep - dead battery warning.

He just wants something that'll charge his phone, is compact, and made by a reputable company.  However, I think Gramps understands the basics of fitting things into things. A square will not fit into a trapezoid, for example. A square does fit into a slightly bigger square. This is generally accepted as common knowledge.So someone explain to me: why do people buy a charger - clearly labeled as having MINI USB plugs - and get mad when their MICRO USB doodads won't work with it?! ...Sorry for the rant. It's just...come on, people. Do some research or read the product description, at least. You can get mini USB to micro USB adapters on eBay for about $2-3. You can even get a mini USB to regular USB adapter, so you can use the charger with any USB cord you have.Now, to the charger. I saw a refurb for $4 and decided to try one. It's well designed and compact, at less than three inches tall and about an inch thick. The LED indicator is easy to understand. The mini USB output slides away when not in use, which also turns off the charger to save power. Unfortunately mine only adds about 1100mAh to my phone, which isn't the 1700mAh claimed. Maybe it depends on your phone - I charged a Nexus 4 (with the adapters). And its output current is around 0.5A, so it will charge slowly - or simply slow down your phone's discharging if you're playing games or something.Currently at $6, it works out to 283mAh/$. That's not a very good deal when you can get a 325mAh/$ PowerBot for only two dollars more.

As far as I could find, it is the ONLY unit that works in ANY fashion. EverReady has a weird thing for $9.99 at Target, but it did not charge at all.It is small, solid and feels well made. The only moving part is the push-switch that pushes out the mini-USB to plug into the charger port on the phone. The light appropriately glows when the unit is charging and charging a phone. It is too bulky to fit comfortably in a pocket for an extended period but perfect to keep in any small carrying bag. It would fit in a typical car ash-tray.Droid X and other micro-USB port owners MUST buy a miniUSB(F)-to-microUSB(M) adapter.The unit plugs into the adapter which plugs into the phone. It does trickle charge my phone. After about 15 minutes my X went from 0% to 10%. Another 30 minutes (45 total with the phone off) was required to go to 20%. The unit is not made for the higher-powered battery type used by the X. Once I confirmed that the unit will charge the battery enough for use, I did not see how long it took to charge, how many recharges I could get, or how long the unit will hold it's own charge.Now, with that all said, the only place to comfortably accomplish this is to leave the phone and unit sitting quietly on top of a desk or other surface. While the unit plugged into the adapter plugged into the phone will fit in cargo-pants pockets or a bag, the adapter will invariably and in shortly unplug from the phone. I found myself carrying the phone with the unit in the same hand, which is serviceable and not as uncomfortable as you would think. And it did not stop the adapter from regularly popping out of the charging port on the phone (it never popped out of the unit). Using it in this fashion kept my phone operating at least 30 minutes longer than if I did not have the unit.So, the unit works. It is portable and it charges the phone.I would recommend this because the X only lasts AT MOST a day on a charge, and if you get stuck for any period of time (the essential time when you would want your phone operational) this unit, for a small insurance investment, would keep it going.","4.0","Not perfect for Droid X","1283904000","09 8, 2010"

"AHZYI1KAJSQP6","B000KK1MAC","Sardonic","[9, 9]","Previous experience:Pogo SketchTargus stylusEDIT:This stylus is awesome! No degradation in performance over time as you get with the foam tipped units. Good for writing, drawing and pressing buttons. Pen works well.*Note: If you want to save money, the Targus and Griffin stylus are identical to this one. This one just has a pen built in and is MUCH nicer in terms of quality and build of product. Functionality is the same though.Just bought the Boxwave in my quest for the best stylus. This one has the rubber soft tip which I like better than the foam. I think the rubber tipped styli show more of an effort in development rather than the left over circuit foam styli that might as well tell you that you're not worth the R&D; (pogo).Out of the box this thing feels like a small to medium sized pen. It actually is an ink pen on one end and a stylus on the other. With regard to dual function styli, I like this one because the pen is capped and when you are not using it, the cap adds to the body of the stylus as if there is no separate piece.Looks great too.I have to compare it to the Targus or Griffin one because that's the closest in similarity. It does seem to be slightly more sensitive than the Targus, not deal breaker sensitive but depending on what application you are using, it could mean the difference between smooth writing and less than smooth writing. (your hand weight, writing pressure and writing style make a difference too). It's about a half an inch longer than the Targus, which gives it some nice pen like feel in  your hand.This feels more like a pen than the Targus does, and while that has to do with the fact that it actually is an ink pen as well, it's also to do with construction of the item.On tests using Penultimate, Upad, Paperdesk, Note Taker HD, and Neu.notes I found the boxwave to perform very well and objectively better than the targus. However, I think at this point that all rubber tipped styli will perform similarly and it might come down to which device feels the best in your hand. As with ink pens, how the item feels is just as important and can play a role in quality of writing as how it actually writes. In this case, both the ink pen and the stylus function work well and do their job properly. I am overall pleased with this but I am reserving jumping jacks for a few weeks of use to see how it performs after some wear.In comparison to the pogo, there is no comparison. This to the pogo is like a ferrari to a yugo. The pogo being the yugo. I would not mind if the boxwave came in a slimmer barrel and had aluminum anodized colors, but I will likely never go back to a foam tip.Saying that though, I have to say as before, your writing style will dictate which type of stylus is right for you. If given the chance, get one of each and see what works better or try them out in the store. Had I done that with the foamies, I would have stayed away, but I can see that they would work for some people.I think the price I paid for this stylus is good, but I would not pay more since I really do believe now that the rubber tip is going to be pretty much the same. Unless you pay more for aesthetics do not pay more because you believe the tips will be different, they won't be. Griffin, Targus and Boxwave rubber tipped styli are identical even down to the silver metal band that holds the tip to the barrel. Identical.I would, and probably will buy another Boxwave stylus.Pros:Good weightVery nice construction and materialsQuality feel over other brands, doesn't feel like a generic stick, actually feels like thought went into it.Ink is refillable with standard store bought refills. Included ink works well but is clearly genericMetal barrel with metal ink head. Dual O-rings on ink end prevent debris from entering barrel and keep cap tightCons:None really. Only wish the cap could be fit over the stylus when using the ink pen, but that would create a design issueWill update if I find any issue during use.","5.0","First Impressions- So far so good","1302307200","04 9, 2011"

"AOTY05YYW58RK","B000KKKI0M","Dan N.","[0, 2]","When I heard one of the previous reviews mentioning about this protector as a soft plastic, I assumed it was the same as or similar to the polyurethane material like InvisibleShield products.  I've had a polyurethane screen protector before and it was great, but I've been having trouble trying to find a similar product to InvisibleShield that are less expensive.  Basically it's supposed to be the stuff that is used to protect helicopter blades.Back to the WriteRight protectors, I was glad that it came in a pack of 10 becuase I knew it might take me several tries to get it to fit perfectly.  Unfortunately with my Nokia N95-3 it took me about 5 times and I still couldn't get it right.  Good thing I only need half a sheet to fit my phone's screen.  (technically I have 20 sheets) I think it's harder because my screen is surrounded by the border of the phone with rounded edges.  That makes it harder to measure the size and having to estimate the curve of the corners.  I also applied it to my girlfriend's Sidekick LX, which was much easier because of the screen.First of all, you pretty much have to get it right on the screen on the first try otherwise the more attempts you make, the more dust the adhesive side will pick up.  Secondly, there will be many air bubbles you have to try to push out.  The ones in the middle are pretty easy to push out as you apply, but the border ones are tricky.  When you try to push some of the bubbles out, it looks like is just becomes a smudge that you can't push any further.When successfully applied to the screen it looks fairly clear.  There is, however, a rainbow tint from the light when you look at certain angles.  Not a major problem.  Yes, the protector will attract dust, but I believe that is true of many screen protectors; as my previous InvisibleShield protector also did.  The protector does scuff fairly easily as well.  When I used a paper towel and alcohol to clean off the oil on my screen it left a slight scuff where I was rubbing.  None of the scuffs, smudges, or bubbles effect the clarity of the screen when I'm using the phone.  Only when the backlight is off is when I can see the imperfections in the screen protector, which is still a little annoying to me.All in all, they give you 10 in a pack probably because they expect each of them not to last that long.  If you just want a protector that will prevent your original screen from getting damaged, this will work.  But if you want absolute perfection with the backlight on and off, I am certain there are better products out there.","3.0","Wishing it was better...","1215907200","07 13, 2008"

No more having to use a blade to scratch away the stickers pieces at a time as it breaks apart.Just cut the screen protector to the proper size.  Stick the car or parking sticker on the non-sticky side of the screen protector carefully.  Remove the film on the sticky side of the screen protector and apply to the windshield where you would like.When it's time to remove, just use a box cutter or flat, sharp edge to pull up one of the corners of the sticker, and you should be able to slowly peel the entire sticker off as a single piece with minimal residual leftovers on the windshield.","5.0","I use these to put Parking & City stickers on the windshield of our cars","1357171200","01 3, 2013"

"A1P5TN3N6L155V","B000KKKI0M","Keith LeDuc leduckut","[8, 8]","I really have a problem when I read these reviews, not only on this product but others as well, and I have read a lot of them, when people complain when they haven't even given the product a chance to prove its worthiness because they are way too impatient to truly check the product out. I say this because, I agree that these screen protectors do scratch really easy especially if you use some sort of squeegie to apply them with. Because of all that scratchiness, they do appear slightly fuzzy and not shiny and clear like other brands. But, when my phone is on and the LCD is lit, I see no issue what so ever. My screen is still very easy to read and appears much like it would without some sort of screen protector on. Now, the very interesting part is about the bubbles that most of you are complaining about. Yes, when I installed mine, there were a few bubbles, some smaller and one very large one. At first I was annoyed by this but you have to remember, you have to make sure your screen is ultimately clean and free of debris before you ever install these or any other brand of screen protector. Otherwise, any dust spec on your screen before you apply the protector will cause a bubble. If you touch the sticky side of the protector before installing it, this will cause bubbles and it will NOT adhere to your screen very good. But, if you have patience like me and loose some of that angriness most of you seem to put forward, I have noticed that within a few days, without me doing any other proding or scratching to try to get rid of the bubbles, the bubbles have disappeared and taken care of theirselves. Imagine that. Because of that reason alone, I will NOT be pealing this one off and trying anything else. I like that it has an extra stickiness and it stays in place really well. The fact that I can still view my screen without any differnce makes me think these aren't near as bad as some of you folks complain about. Now, I can admit that I haven't tried using my phone outside in the bright sun yet. My phone use is mostly restricted to in home use. But, I can say, as with ANY device with an LCD screen, whether it be a laptop, cell phone, Ipod, digital camera....anything with an LCD screen, you can't see them well outside anyway. You have to admit that to yourself. The brightness of the direct sun tends to fade what you see once you are outside. So those of you complaining that these protectors make too much glare (glare? really?) in the sun, I say lighten up! I had a cell phone once that when the LCD screen was exposed to the sun, the sunlight actually lit it up differently and made it easier to see outside. I had a car stereo that did the same thing...when sun hit the display, it still lit up by the sunlight so you could still see it. I feel more LCD products need to consider this, but we are not reviewing them. So anyway...I just feel you people need to lighten up and not be so critical all the time.

After application, and only rubbing the protector with microfiber, it was scratched past the point of no return. I cannot imagine what this screen protector would look like after a few days of use.Although this product may protect the screen, after a couple of days use you probably won't be able to see the screen with all the accumulated scratches.

This latter item item didn't score well with other Amazon customers--proof that you can't always trust the ratings.In the case of this Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder, you can trust the consumer ratings--in fact, they may even be a bit high. The device is branded as a Cellet universal mount in the title, but in the description it's referred to as a Luxmo universal mount.  No matter. A poorly designed piece of plastic is--by any name--a potentially useless piece of plastic.The idea here is that you can, if you choose, unscrew the base and toss it so that it's not in the way of the bracket, which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient vent.  Unfortunately, my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket, or Vent Mount (non)solution.  So it was on to Plan B, the Dash Mount solution (at least it's a versatile little fellow).  But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch.  Moreover, I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try.  So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation: it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot!Here's where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte--i.e. making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better.  In other words, I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this adjustable guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised.  Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo's right arm, nothing happened.  His right arm was jammed (and the left is clearly non-adjustable).  Since he obviously needed a helping hand, I gave him one.  Unfortunately, my gentle tugging  pressure was enough to snap off that piece of plastic on the right side of this holder with the (non) Adjustable Grip.Mercifully, the experience came to an end before I'd given this low-(but over)priced imposter a chance to show its stuff.  But even more fortunately, I can now put this review to rest.  May the next buyer have a happier story to tell.  As for me, I'm back to my original clunky and unsightly but effective mount with the gooseneck:GSI Super Quality Wireless Hands-Free 5-in-1 Dock-Mount-Charger-FM Transmitter-Car Kit, with Goose-neck Mount for Ipod, IPhone 4-3G-3GS, MP3, MP4, CD, DVD Players - Includes Remote Control, Audio Cable, LCD Display - Cigarette Lighter Plug-In.","2.0","Broke it during installation (but few regrets)","1339286400","06 10, 2012"

I made some repairs to strengthen it, but first use showed that this device does not work well with any smart phones.  I have an iPhone, and it's too wide and tall for this device.  You can't clamp your phone very well because of the cheap design, and the bottom ledge is too small.

If you phone doesn't have such a connection, then you may want to look into a different phone because nothing without a direct connection is going to work, and you may want to look into a phone that gets better reception (there are some -- just read the 3rd party reviews).I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you just have money to burn.

There are cutouts for everything except the volume buttons.  I tested the volume buttons first since some cases make it difficult to press the buttons.  No so with this case.  Very easy to press.The cutout for the rear facing mic leaves plenty of room between the mic and cutout (the mic is perfectly centered within the cutout).  The bottom mic is a bit off-center within the bottom cutout, but it's far enough from the material.  Cutouts for LED and rear facing camera match the pics that accompany the product description.  Cutouts for power/IR and headphone jack are centered.Case is very snug (I like that).  Bumper provides a nice grip since it is textured.  There is a good sized lip on the case that will protect the screen when placed faced down on a flat surface.Once concern with other brands is that the hard material sometimes separates from the TPU material. I'll update the review in a few months after I use this case for awhile.This case replaces a Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit Clear case... mainly because the Cruzerlite's idea of clear is actually frosted white.  And it cost $12.90.Overall, this BoxWave is great case for $5.70 that was Prime eligible.*******************UPDATE:  2013-09-28*******************I bought 2 of these cases since we have 2 HTC Ones in the family.  My case is still great.  My daughters case, on the other hand, has not fared as well. The rubber bumper has separated almost completely from the hard case after 2 months of use.  I downgraded my rating.  5 stars for my case, 1 star for my daughter's case, and the average is 3 stars.","3.0","Not so Nice (was  Very Nice Case before the update)","1367971200","05 8, 2013"

I use a wired headset with a boom mic at work due to background noise causing too much interference with the mic on my Bluetooth headset.  Headset has 3.5mm plug.  Bought this to use the headset with the LG.  While I can hear the caller with both ears, the MIC does not work!  I had another adaptor I had used with an earlier LG, and it had the same problem, but hoped this would work based on the (admittedly vague) description and a review specifically stating it worked with the Octane.  Apparently, that reviewer only wanted it for music, even though that's not what he stated.  Anyway, the same headset worked fine in a Motorola Droid RAZR with a built in 3.5mm jack.  I knew this was a crapshoot.  I lost.  Hope to keep others from repeating my mistake.Also, the adaptor I got is white- the pictures of it vary depending on how you search for it, and change from the item description to the picture in your shopping cart.  This is a pretty sketchy listing for Amazon.  Wasn't sure what I was getting, and didn't get what I expected.  Oh, well.  Only $3 wasted.","2.0","For music only.

He had not previously used a bluetooth device, and I wanted to make sure that he could answer his phone without taking his eyes off the road.  Both of us were using the new iPhone 4.  So how did the Discover 665 compare to the 925?  In general, it worked well, with easy pairing and one-touch answering.  Where it lagged, however, was in audio quality. I could hear him, but he couldn't always hear me, and occasionally his transmission had some vibrato and/or muffling.  While the problem could have been with my 925, I've used it for years without such issues.  He has since used it to answer calls from our land line, and occasionally the sound quality just isn't there.So why four stars?  Well, it is comfortable enough to wear (without the ear hook) for hours, if necessary, and most of the time it works well, with no noticeable audio defects.  Plus, for the price level, it works much better than anything I ever had from Motorola.  It's easy to find the buttons to answer/hang up and adjust the volume.  I consider this a good choice for a budget bluetooth device, although people who plan on using one every day for important calls will probably want to upgrade to a more expensive model.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann","4.0","Good performance for budget bluetooth -- but not a high end unit (4-stars)","1283731200","09 6, 2010"

I don't know if there's another way to do this but once you insert that SIM card, you have to have a child take it out. Almost impossible for me to grab and pull out.- Speakerphone is really low and almost inaudible even with the volume cranked up- Vibrate on the phone is really... mild. If it's in your pocket, you probably won't feel it. Especially if you're on the train, for example.- Long boot up compared to the two non Symbian phones I had.- very annoying pop port .. i didn't think it would be an issue but if you have to hold the phone with two hands to insert your headset... annoying.- no emoticons on txt messages??!!- to reply to a txt you have to hit options->reply->via txt msg. Why can't i just hit reply and go straight to the txt box?- zoom on phone takes f o r e v e r.- where is the STOPWATCH and COUNTDOWN TIMER?!- fingerprints/face prints get xfrd to phone easily- my battery life : internet use only on/off = 4-6 hours with 2 10min calls and 6hours standby; MobiRadio on speaker, continuous = 1.5hours; mixed internet, mobiradio, regular radio, phone calls, text messaging, tinkering with phone= 6 hours or so. All hours est from full charge to when the batt just dies. Includes intermittent standbys and where I just look through the phone.The charger is now tethered to my hip.Like:- really soft and big keys- ability to move around the files/ folders- Nice big screen- Video (choppy and pixelated but it will do)will con't as the months pass.....**UPDATE:-battery life has improved significantly. I still use it 13hrs a day but I now charge just once a day. And i use it more.-I also bought this primarily as an MP3 player and I'm having the same problem that I had with the 6230. The shuffle is not really a shuffle. I have about 200 songs in there and it insists on playing the same songs over and over every 10th-15th song... it seems to loop to songs I've heard already every single time.-I use the HS-31 headset that I had before and the volume is just really low. I have to roll the windows up in my car in order to carry a conversation. I thought it was just the speakerphone that had a low volume. The bluetooth earpiece was loud, though.-And finally, 3G. I found no discernable difference between EDGE and the 3G networks while downloading video or viewing webpages. Maybe it loaded up a page a few seconds faster but that was about it. Mobiradio still buffered every now and then in 3G networks so that was surprising as well.I'm still going to keep the phone, though.","3.0","Ehh...","1181088000","06 6, 2007"

Reason the review is in the past tense is that from one use to the next the volume up control stopped working. The volume down button worked, so I tried lowering the volume to the bottom and then increase..oh well..it reached the bottom and won't increase, so essentially you can't hear any sound out of it any longer.

"A36K2N527TXXJN","B000NKCO5Q","Dr. Bojan Tunguz","[2, 2]","I've been looking for a long time to buy Bluetooth stereo headphones for the workouts in the gym - I got tired of having to deal cords that would get tangled up during the workouts or would become a mess in the gym bag. When this model came out I jumped at the opportunity to buy them since they were the first stereo Bluetooth headset with a form factor that is appropriate for wearing in public. (Most of the other ones are too big and just scream Look at me, I am a dork!) And since I bought them a little over a year ago, I have been extremely satisfied with them - for the most part. Here are a few pros and cons that I have come up with.Pros:1. Comfortable enough for a daily workout. Even with my moderately large head, I did not have much of a comfort issue with wearing them every day for a couple of hours. I would not recommend wearing them for more than three hours in a row though. But that would be the case with most headphones anyways.2. Easy setup. I had no problem connecting them to either my cell phone/mp3 player or my laptop.3. Decent range. As long as there is an uninterrupted line of sight between the linking device and the headset, you can use them on the other side of a large room or a smaller gym. Comes in handy when working out and don't want anything attached to any part of your body.4. Decent music playback sound.5. Decent battery life. For a relatively small device like this one, it was pleasing to find out that it did not have to be recharged more than a couple of times a week with standard use.6. As a phone earpiece it is useful to have around the head headset because it improves stability a lot. All of my other earpieces fall out of my ears way too easily.7. Being transferred from the mp3 player to the phone when receiving an incoming call is really useful and cool.Cons:1. It would be really useful if these headphones were collapsible. In that case they could be taken with you in your pocket almost anywhere you go. Plus, it would avoid dangers of having them twisted while stored in your bag.2. Touch-sensitive controls are too sensitive and very, very small. It took me a while to get used to them.3. The stereo feature works only for music. When using them for calling, only the left earpiece delivers sound, which is sort of weird. This takes some time to get used to.4. For some reason, when I linked them to my laptop, they got de-linked with my cell-phone. I had to go through the whole process again to have them back in the desired configuration.Unfortunately, a week ago one of the touch-sensitive controls broke, and now I can't increase the volume. This is really annoying because other than that they still work great. I tried sending them back to Motorola, but apparently they don't fix products that are bought through Amazon, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE BRAND NEW! This is extremely annoying to say the least. I decided to buy a new pair, and found another one on Amazon for $50. (So if at the moment all the available ones are more expensive than that, you may want to wait a bit.) Since this price is about 2.5 times cheaper than what you could get in any AT&T; store, it seems to me a worth-while investment. I figured that paying about $50 a year for something that I get to use every day is worth it.","4.0","Worked fine while it worked","1216598400","07 21, 2008"

Because of the size they're apparently not able to get a big enough battery in to make battery life acceptable.  It's okay, but these are the first headphones that have actually gone dead on me because I didn't charge them enough.Also, size apparently effects the transmitter/receiver in them.  People I talk to on the phone constantly complain about my voice dropping out.  And if the headphones aren't reasonably close to the phone, or the phone's not on the right side of my body I start hearing static.Also, related to phone calls, and this is the most annoying thing of all - when on the phone you can only hear out of one ear!  Super annoying!  You might say so what - you can only hear out of one ear on a home phone.  But with a cell phone you're outside where there is more noise and often times the ability to hear out of both ears is the difference between being able to continue the conversation or having to end it.Plus, it's really annoying to have the ear buds in both ears but only hear sound coming out of one ear.  What were they thinking!!??And I agree with the others who have slightly larger than average heads.  They're really uncomfortable after about 10-15 minutes.

Good Lord i can't stress this enough. i'm not a small man, and i'm not stretching these out--but i've had to remove one side from my ears just so its not like my head is in a vice grip.2)Design of buttons==buttons are on the vertical band which raises upward from the earbuds towards the arch that goes over the ears. that means everytime you go to switch a song, change the volume, or press Play--you're pressing a small nub of plastic forward which digs into the arch of your inner ear and feels like someone's twisting it with needle nose pliers. this has to be the most annoying aspect of these headphones.to explain: any time you press your index fingers against your ear to block out sounds--you're pressing against a small flap of skin/cartiledge. this small flap of skin/cartiledge is bent forward/outward whenever you change volume/track & literally causes a headache every time.solutions: possibly smaller ear buds? i'm looking into it. but for the time being--i have to make due with what i've got.for the price--they're awesome. as a runner--they don't short-out when you sweat on them. they're really adequate when you DON'T press the buttons.i give this product 2 of 5 stars+1 star for easy ability to pair+1 star for signal strength-2 star for uncomfortability (really, they're that uncomfortable)-1 star for design in placement of buttons","2.0","Agonizingly & painfully nice","1290729600","11 26, 2010"

This is a comfortable headset that doesn't scream for attention and allows me to have a functional hands-free phone experience. I will get right down to the pros and cons:PROS:* Comfortable to wear and stay in place.* Very good call reception quality.* Decent stereo music playback quality.* Fairly good battery life.* Universal USB charging port.* Easy pairing.* Good looks that don't look ridiculous or rude.CONS:* Sometimes very poor call quality when talking. I've had people complain that they had a hard time understanding me while I'm driving (windows shut, stereo off). I think it amplifies ambient sound that will drown out voice.* Music sound quality requires a bass boost. I've found that this headset is geared more for voices in the middle and higher ranges. Music can sound tinny.* There is a need for an adjustable headband. The headset stays on, but can sometimes feel like it's flopping in the back. I have a medium (7 1/4) hat size.I don't think this product is quite there, especially if you are looking to use it for phone calls. I use mine primarily with a BlackBerry Pearl and a Motorola Q and the better sound quality comes from the BlackBerry, so the type of device you are using with it does matter.Still, I received this as a gift for Christmas, 2007, and was excited at the time. I would suggest looking in to the newer version, the Motorola S9-HD, which has improved sound quality:[...]","3.0","Cool looks, mediocre performance.","1223337600","10 7, 2008"

"A25TNBMJ4ZO7RD","B000NKCO5Q","M. Potvin","[1, 1]","I'll first start out by saying that I absolutely love these headphones. I never really thought that I'd be so happy going with a cordless headphone, but the convenience factor is amazing. When I'm in our small office, I can leave my BlackBerry sitting on my desk, and walk anywhere in the office, fill up my coffee, go to the fridge, and never drop out. Sound quality is relatively good, about what you'd expect from a headphone that is oriented towards an active lifestyle that is making some compromise on design for sound quality.The buds that will come installed are garbage. Don't even bother with them, they hurt my ears after wearing for a short period of time. Make sure you put the rubber ones that are symmetrical on. My buddy bought a white box kit from another vendor who was selling for much cheaper, and they didn't come with any of the accessories, so be careful where you buy!In regards to dropping out. Strangely, with my phone on my hip, the signal does sometimes drop out. Very intermittent, talking like a fraction of a second, but of course noticeable when you're playing music.The protrusion of the headphones from the back of the head is very pronounced. They are a snug fit going around your head, some people complain that they don't think that they will be able to get them on. I have a big head (self proclaimed) and I have no issues with that. I can't sit back on the sofa with them on because of the protrusion. Likewise, this means you can't bench press wearing these headphones.The headphones also double as a hands free headset. The mic is back near the earpiece. I didn't think that it would pick up speech very well, but it does quite a good job as a handsfree device as well. I don't recommend driving with it of course, I use it at the office. The BlackBerry rings in the earpiece when listening to music to alert you to a call. Another caveat is that there is no notification in the headset when you receive an email.I've had great success pairing these with the Jabra A120S. I actually hooked up the Jabra to the audio out on my LCD TV so I can listen to the TV (ie. play on the Wii) without disturbing others. My wife uses it for the same purpose while on the treadmill so she doesn't need to blast the volume. I used the A120 on a Creative Vision with these headphones as well. No complaints. Now that I have an iPod (wake up Apple - give us BT) I'll use the A120 for pairing when I need this style headphone.Overall the cordless convenience is very nice. They could use some refinement, but they are a nice addition to your headphone collection. I would not classify them as an audiophile headset, but an active headset that can take some light abuse.","4.0","Getting there, but not quite","1207008000","04 1, 2008"

I like headphones but the cord can be annoying, especially when it catches on something.  With these cordless headphones, that annoyance is gone, replaced by an occasional amazement at how nice it is to be cordless and how well they work.  They can play surprisingly convincing rock or classical music at higher volumes (though I usually listen at low-to-mid volume).I connect to an iPod (through a Jabra bluetooth adapter) and a Motorola phone, which works very well.  The links are easy to establish or restart and I have experienced almost no interference or dropping-out of the signal.  Using an adapter means you cannot control the iPod with the S9 buttons but that is a minor nuisance (though it would be nice if a new iPod had that capability).  The S9 does not play stereo directly from a Macintosh computer currently but Apple's new operating system (Leopard) is rumored to provide that capability.  The rechargeable battery in the S9 last many hours; the first charge lasted only about 3 hours, subsequent charges have lasted 5 hours or so.I have only one reservation and one wish: although they are comfortable, they do eventually hurt after many hours of non-stop wearing and I wish they were more sound-isolating (in-ear).","4.0","Great sound & convenience","1181606400","06 12, 2007"

Drew Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...","[36, 44]","40 days into using the headphones I have the same problem as many other users - the touch controls stopped working. I can't change the volume (It's stuck all the way on low!) or change songs.  Since I'm past the 30 day return period, I'm stuck.  I'll have to sent them to Moto. Hopefully in warranty.New review - ZERO stars.Following is the original review....I've been using the headset for a week, pretty much non-stop. The sound clarity is amazing. No, they're not the same as high-end audiophile quality headphones - after all the speakers are really, really tiny!  The bass suffers, but they are equivalent to any other compact headphones - minus the cables.I paired these with my Chocolate cell phone in seconds and was playing music the next minute.  Seamless control of the playlist and volume. Yes, you have to use a playlist - that's a function of the player, not the headphones.  The thing charges from the provided AC adapter  or from a USB port - handy!Since the bulk of the headset is behind the neck, the headset gets in the way on some sets.  Lat pull-downs or good mornings for example.  Tilting the head down helps this, or making sure the bar lands more on the shoulders - but this really effects the rep. I tried it a couple of routines and had pretty bad neck pain the next day.  So for those reps, the headset comes off.The soft touch buttone took some getting used to, but after a few fumble-finger attempts I got the hang of it.  The distance - well, I was in the gym and walked 20 steps from my gym bag (that's where the cell phone was) - never lost the signal!The gym is the primary reason for purchasing these. I ruined too many compact headsets over the years and finally stopped using them.  The wires would get tangled on the weight bench, it was a pain doing anything overhead, and upright rows were downright dangerous (my thumbs and elbows would snag the wires.)There are occational 1/4 second drop outs - walking into and out of Home Depot for example - they have a lot of Bluetooth devices running.  Sometimes in the mall.  If I wear them around for five or six hours I experience two or three of these dropouts, but never at home or the office. The signal comes back immediately and I never lose connection.As a Cell Phone headset - pretty bad.  When the phone rings, so does the headset.  Press then answer button on the headset and you're talking on the phone.  The mic is on the headset and you have to be in a quiet place.  I was in my car, radio off.  The person calling could hardly hear me and there was a noticeable echo.  I was not even aware of this feature when purchasing the headset, so the poor quality of the headphones as a cell phone headset is not really a negative.As other reviewers have stated, the cell phone tones, ring and sounds all come from the left speaker - not both.  I believe this is a function of the cell phone.Overall, I'm very pleased with this device.Followup: My chocolate 8500 had to be exchanged. Three times. There's a bug when it comes to MP3 files. More than 50 and the phone locks up.  The Chocolate 8500 also required a playlist to work, so the headset had to use a playlist. My new 8550 has no such limitation. I have 450 songs on the thing and no playlists.  Now it's even easier.Also, charging from a USB port.  It will NOT charge from my laptop, desktop, or car USB adaptor!  It does charge from the included 110V USB charger.  Strange.","5.0","Wow! Cool factor of 100, functionality 95! BUT - died in 40 days!!!","1186963200","08 13, 2007"

Holding the blackberry in my hand seems to improve the reception somewhat but that defeats the purpose.This is quite disappointing since I wanted to use these when I am out running so I am back to my wired headphones.  I am not sure if this is due to the Blackberry or the headphones itself.

"A3NEAETOSXDBOM","B000NKCO5Q","Stephen M. Charme","[113, 114]","My ipod nano's wired headphones annoy me when I exercise, so I wanted to find a wireless alternative. I was a little hesitant about buying these headphones and the ipod adaptor because of some negative reviews, but after using them I was happy to find that I have had no problems. In fact, these work great. The headphones fit comfortably in my ear and are easy to take on and off. The sound quality is better than my ipod headphones and is actually quite good. The touch sensitive controls for volume etc. take a little getting used to, but with a little practice they are easy to operate.I am a runner and have used these headphones both on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors, including very windy conditions. I have not experienced any loss of signal once the bluetooth connection has been established--and I have run literally hundreds of miles with this unit.  It is a real pleasure to listen to my ipod without wires dangling all over me.Please note that the bluetooth connection between the headphones and the ipod does not take place instantly. Turn the headphones on and wait for the solid blue light to come on that indicates that the headphones are in bluetooth mode. Then (1) turn on the ipod, (2) insert the adaptor (Note: inserting the adaptor before turning on the ipod did not permit a bluetooth connection to be established), (3) select the first song, and (4) hit the play button on the ipod. There is usually a delay of 10-40 seconds before the headphones make a bluetooth connection with the ipod. Not a big deal. I just restart the song from the beginning.Making a bluetooth connection with my Samsung u-740 cell phone was a snap, and answering calls on the headphones was easy. I had no problem with sound quality.Before purchasing these headphones and adaptor, you should keep some things in mind.First, in order to insert the adaptor into the opening on the bottom of the ipod, either your ipod must be out of the case or you need a case that will give access. I use the latest Contour clear case, which does not permit a completely snug fit(due to two small plastic tabs around the earphone hole; you can remove these if you want), but snug enough so that a bluetooth connection can be established and the adaptor is in tight enough so that I don't worry about it falling out, and in fact it hasn't happened even when I run over rough terrain in the park. I bought an armband intended for the ipod shuffle, and use the belt clip on my Contour case to clip my ipod and inserted adaptor to the armband when I run. Everything is nice and secure.Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headphones on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headphones did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headphones on first.Third, since the headphones are curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headphones, which will come slightly out of their position in your ears. So wearing the headphones with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headphones as the collar pushes against them. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use these headphones comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane).Fifth, because the bluetooth adaptor goes into the socket that is used for charging, there is no way to use the adaptor and charge your ipod at the same time, as you can do using earbuds. Therefore for a long car or plane ride you are better off using your earbuds or some other headset.So don't throw away your ipod earbuds or over-the-ear headsets, but do enjoy this unit in those situations where the limitations I described above don't matter.All in all I am very satisfied with this product. If you are looking for a wireless solution, albeit not a perfect one, this is it.Update Nov. 10, 2008: I have now been using this product for one year and have been very satisfied with its performance. However, I am now on my third pair.Shortly before Labor Day, the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement set of headphones. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.I started going to a new gym this fall, and it tends to very humid where the treadmills are. A couple of nights ago I was drenched in sweat and so were the headphones. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the earbuds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be zapped by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that these headphones are not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my new gym. Now that I know about the problem, I will just wipe them periodically before the sweat really builds up.Update January 18, 2009: This headset does not work with the iPod Touch 2G. Although the headset connects with the adaptor that I put in the Touch, no sound comes out. I suspect this is because the Touch 2G, unlike my iPod Nano, can play music without headphones. No idea if this headset works on a Touch 1G, though I suspect it does not.Update February 2, 2009: Building up lots of sweat that can zap these headphones is only a problem for me when I run indoors on a treadmill rather than when I run outside (even in the summer I run very early in the morning when it is still cool). The problem can be avoided by periodically wiping the headphones during a workout, but I got tired of doing that. Therefore I purchased the Sennheiser PMX 70 headphones (which do have a cord, and which I have reviewed on Amazon) to use in the gym instead of this headset, which I will now use only for running outdoors.Update January 22, 2012: I recently bought the iPhone 4S. This headset works flawlessly with it. No need for a separate bluetooth adaptor and no need to enter any passcode to pair this. Just turn bluetooth on for the iPhone 4S (make sure you do this first, or pairing may not work), and then turn on this headset. Bingo! You are connected.Update March 17, 2012: I figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back. Turn the headset upside down (So the M now looks like a W), put it in back of your head, and put the earbuds into your ears without looping anything over your hears like you usually do. The back of the headset will now be flush against your neck, and you can comfortably lay back on a beach chair etc. Keep in mind that now the phone button and volume controls will be on your right ear instead of your left ear. I can't believe that I didn't think of this sooner.","5.0","Great wireless headphones for your ipod","1195257600","11 17, 2007"

When I saw this come in for review I nearly did a dance for joy because, as we all know, they aren't cheap. These things are like armor for your phone. I have dropped my phone, sat on it, threw it and all kinds of stuff while it had an Otterbox on it and never had a scratched added to it.The problem with this &#34;Defender&#34; series is the screen protector portion. See, getting this thing apart to put it on requires supernatural skills - the same amazing skills are required to get it off once it's on your phone as well. So, yeah, before I could even get it apart to put it on the phone, my finger went through the screen protector, so that part was broken.It takes a little doing to get it on your phone. Maybe it's because I'm not actually a superhero, but after a little grunting and a lot of cursing, it was on. I snapped the screen on it and the rest of it and.... then decided to see how well I could get it off.Hahahahahaha... a bloody finger and more curse words later, it was off.It's on there now and I do have a regular peel and stick screen protector on it, so I never bothered to pick up one of the spares you can buy.It's a GOOD case, don't get me wrong. I have never used the clip that you can optionally use with it, but it looks like it's good quality as well.However, if you do not have Hulk hands, you might want to look at another Otterbox series. This one means business and I don't want to end up with stitches every time I need to open it up to take out a battery or whatever.So, I love Otterbox. I will continue to buy Otterbox. But I will NOT be buying this series. I'm also thinking that when I buy a new case, I should probably just buy a new phone too because I'm not sure I can get this thing off again. *laughing*Recommended for those that need series protection for their phones and don't have a need to swap the case or remove it.","3.0","I love Otterbox.

"A105L5EX9D0NH8","B000NLSGA2","Dueces Wild","[73, 77]","I was a little hesitant at first when ordering this case due to the fact that the defender cases have been super bulky in the past. Much to my surprise, Otterbox and their Defender Series Cases have come a long way since I contemplated ordering one a few years ago. This case is extremely thin for the protection it seems to offer. The build quality is superb and should protect the phone very well! I love the built in screen protector as opposed to trying to line up the sticky screen protectors with a few of the cheaper cases. The price seems fair as well. I paid $49.95 on Amazon. If ordered directly from Otterbox it will cost around $10 more.At the time of this post, the Lifeproof Case for the s5 has not been released. A huge deciding factor in choosing Otterbox over Lifeproof is the mixed reviews the s4 Lifeproof Case received about echoing when people try to talk to you.The belt clip seems to be nice and lock the case into place, but realistically I'll never use it. I keep my phone in my pocket. The buttons seem stiff, but from what I've read it's common at first on Otterbox cases.Overall, this case is a little pricey costing about 25% of the phone's cost after a contract renewal, but I feel it's definitely worth it (especially when you consider the alternative is paying full price for an s5 because yours broke in the middle of your contract). Lifeproof will cost you about $20-$30 more.I'll try to update this review accordingly as time progresses!*****UPDATE: 7/8/2014 - I've had this case for a little over 3 months now and I still really like it! I've only taken it off of my phone 1 time since purchasing (to clean the dust out and reset the phone by pulling the battery). It was very easy and quick to remove. This case has definitely protected my phone against my toddler's destructive ways on numerous occasions. The only problem I've noticed is that sometimes the case's buttons will slip off of the phone's buttons when I try to adjust the volume. It's not a big deal. I just hit the button again until it works correctly.The screen protector is still smooth and my finger is able to glide across it effortlessly, which is nice since I am addicted to my phone and use it almost nonstop.I've talked several coworkers and friends into purchasing this case.

I couldn't be happier with how they have worked. One minor flaw is that you have to be quite careful with the hard case snaps (slotted slip overs). They are easy to break. With such good luck on prior Defenders, I decided to get one when I upgraded to the Galaxy S5.The good news: same rugged quality of construction on the S5 Defender case.The REALLY good news: when I added the Samsung OEM wireless charging back cover, I managed (with some effort and a small compromise) to get the Defender case to fit over the slightly larger back cover. It isn't perfect, but it is serviceable. The snaps don't fully engage and there is a tiny separation at the bottom  (where the wired charging port connects), but, the case is held securely in place by the rubber/silicone wrap around. From the front, top, sides and back, the case looks like a perfect fit. All buttons and openings line up just as they should. Only by looking at the bottom do you notice the fit isn't perfect.The Bonus: The Samsung wireless charging adapter charges the S5 IN THE DEFENDER CASE!This is the unit I purchased on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F358AVI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1So, the combination of Otterbox Defender/Samsung Back Cover/Wireless Receiver/Samsung Wireless charger, work very well together, with the slight issue of the case not fitting perfectly, but workably.

"A2GSJUETASGMO0","B000NLSGA2","rose thyme","[0, 0]","I want to like this case as it has what I am looking for in a phone case. It has complete protection for the screen and the phone itself without the need for a separate screen protector. The case has 3 components to it, the hard plastic inner shell which prevents any immediate damage to the phone itself. After the hard plastic casing is in place, the softer rubber part of the case fits over that and snaps into place better than some less expensive cases I've tried. The feel of the softer case is great, you will not feel like you will drop the case once this is installed. If you have small hands, and can hold the S5 by itself, with this case you may not. This case adds a lot of width to the S5, which was already a big phone and almost makes this as big as the Galaxy Note with this case on. I can still easily access the fingerprint scanner, camera, speaker and USB plug. The buttons remain responsive and easy to click on both sides. I use the headphone jack quite frequently, so I would have to assume that continually removing the flap to access the headphone jack might cause it to wear down over time. The front portion of the case has a significant border that keeps the phones screen from being anywhere near the surface underneath it, but again, this bulk is noticeable. I prefer to use a phone case that has a belt clip available and the belt clip that comes with this case is very sturdy. The phone clicks solidly into place and is unlikely to accidentally fall out while on a belt. Overall this case does have everything I'm looking for: protection, added grip, and a belt holster. The added bulk however is a concern for me that even with larger hands it does change the size of the phone in a noticeable manner.","4.0","Everything adds Bulk","1403395200","06 22, 2014"

The plastic two piece holder which you place your phone in doesn't connect tightly, feels real loose over the phone before placing it in the rubber outside protection price. Once inside the remaining rubber piece the volume buttons don't line up properly nor does the power button. The strip at the bottom of the case that's right below the home button is to high basically making you disable the fingerprint scanning portion  of the phone.

While I do agree with &#34;don't mess with a winning team&#34;, some phones (like the S5) have evolved a lot, yet the case has not. The finger print scanner on the S5 is very hard to use this Otterbox. Also, it is still not possible to use wireless charging with these cases, which is a real shame. Ideally, a company like this should keep innovating and ensure customers continue to invest in new cases.That said, the protection level is still quite good - not quite &#34;feel fine dropping it&#34;, but I'd certainly wouldn't be too worried to throw my phone in a bag. Additionally, since the S5 offers weather protection on its own, the value proposition of the Defender series is lost a little.","4.0","Good cases - but showing their age with new phone features","1403049600","06 18, 2014"

I have the anodized blue Best Buy version so I wanted a case that didn't cover up the good looks of the phone. The back of the phone is protected well.  Holes for the camera, flash and speaker are in the proper locations.  There are cutouts on the right side for the volume rocker and the top and bottom are fully exposed. This includes the top portion of the phone over the speakers.  This is a problem for some and I must admit that it does bother me a little when I'm placing the phone on the table face down.  There is a little bit of an edge on the sides that keep the phone raised off a flat surface (when face down).  The case adds very little bulk to the phone and I think it improves the grip of the phone.  The bare phone is a bit silky and slippery.Typically I'm easy on phones and don't need a whole lot of protection.  The exposed portions on the top of the phone do concern me and I have to remind myself not to place the phone in the same pocket as keys or loose change. Other than that the case does what it's supposed to do.  I can already see the thin scratches from daily wear and can imagine what that would look like if I didn't have the case on.Overall I'm happy with this purchase.","4.0","What I expected","1397174400","04 11, 2014"

Thankfully didn't damage the phone, which displays the HTC ONE's superior build quality as it was dropped on hard ceramic tile from 36 counter height. Like I said before the clear plastic will and DOES scratch really easily.I did like that you could barely tell that my phone had a case on it and literally had compliments on that fact, but the risk of damage is too great for me.Just reinstalled the stock smoked(color can't display the awesome brushed aluminum on back)TPU case for now to protect it.ORIGINAL REVIEW:It does fit snug and snaps into place, but very limited edge coverage so won't protect like it should. Feels like it would snap/slip off the edge if dropped, not protecting the phone like it should.

The top and the bottom edges are not covered so protection from dings on two of the edges your device is most likely to fall on is non existent. The way the cut out is over the the volume rocker makes it difficult to use, it is fairly easy to get use to it for the volume only but just try and take a screenshot and it is nearly impossible without taking the case completely off. Speaking about taking the case off....pain in the butt. It has a tiny rim around all the edges to secure it on. That rim,  if you have any type of skin on your device will peel that skin right off. If you do have a habit of using a protective skin on your devices don't pick this case also. Not a good combination. Also right now this case is about 2 weeks in use and shows much wear as far as the clarity of the plastic. Many scratches. Not nearly the long lasting scratch resistance I was looking for when I switched to the hard case. I had much better luck with a couple other clear TPU cases.

If you need all around protection (military, police, etc), look for another case. I like it because of the ease to attach charger, no need to remove from case. It does the job if your just looking to protect your phone in your purse or backpack.

If the phone wasnt tight, it would fall out a week later once it was stretched out. I received this case about 8 days ago, and after 5 the phone fit perfect. Would be hard to fit my needs better.The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 is because you can really only put the phone into the case one way. You must put it in, camera up, with the back of the phone toward you. Since the Droid X unlike most phones is fatter at the top, you must put it in bottom first. By putting the back of the phone toward you the camera goes over the waste clip, and the magnet snap closes properly.Thanks for a great, cheap, case!","4.0","Great case!","1302048000","04 6, 2011"

I've very pleased with this cases.  It fits the Droid X perfectly.  Not too loose, not too snug.  (like most leather cases, it might be a little snug for the first couple of days until it get's broken in) It has a nice, removable and very functional belt clip.  You can remove the standard belt clip and underneath is a swappable belt loot to attach it to a very wide strap.  The magnetic closure is very secure.Yes, as some reviewers have pointed out, it will not fit if you already have another case or skin on the phone already.  However, I'm not sure why you would need those if you plan to carry the phone in this case.  This offers great protection.  It they had made this large enough to fit a phone with one of those on it, it would be way too loose for a bare phone.It is very well constructed with a professional looking fit and finish.  It offers great protection against bumps and fall.If you insert the phone as intended, bottom first, you cannot insert a charger cord.  Not a big deal for me.  This type of case is intended to protect the phone while on your belt, in a purse, etc.  It is not a keep on all the time case.  As such, the fact that certain ports or controls cannot be used while in the case is not an issue for me.  Also, having some of these opening scovered helps protect them from getting plugged with lint or dust.Prior to purchasing this for my Droid X,  I had used the Body Glove case.  It's a nice case but the belt clip on it is worthless.  Also, it offers no protection for the screen, which is the most vulnerable part of the phone.The price on this is excellent.  It a great value given the workmanship and functionality.No case is perfect, but I am very pleased with this one.UPDATE I have had many phone cases and been dissatisfied with most.  Either they do not fit properly, or they do not last. I had to replace some after just a couple of months of use.  After six months of daily use this case almost looks at good as the day I bought it. It has held up remarkably well.","5.0","Great Case, Recommended","1297814400","02 16, 2011"

It is soft and supple and smells like real leather.  I don't like the square emblem they have on the center of the top flap.  I'm not sure what it is supposed to do, but it doesn't look nice.  On second thought, maybe it is to hold the magnet in place.  Even so, they could have picked a nicer emblem, or as I prefer, no emblem at all.So I have a hard cover on my phone, and with that on, it will not fit in the case.  I thought I might be able to squeeze it in because leather is somewhat flexible, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get my phone in this case.  That defeats the whole reason I bought this case.  I did take my cover off and give this case a run around the block.  It seemed to fit well with my cover off.  However,as other reviewers have mentioned, the clip on the back of this case is prone to fall off if you move in the wrong direction or sit down too swiftly.  No matter how much padding this case has, if it is going to fall off my belt constantly, my phone is bound to get damaged.I did recycle this case - I gave it to a friend that has a small enough phone to fit in this case, cover or not.  I warned her about all the flaws, but she still said she would take it off my hands.  She had an ingenious way of solving the clip that snaps out - she super glued it in the slot.  It doesn't move as well, but she said it absolutely doesn't fall off her belt.This case was not expensive, it has nice leather, and my friend is getting to use it, therefore, I gave it 3 stars since she likes it for her phone.","3.0","Doesn't Fit With A Cover On My Droid RAZR","1340668800","06 26, 2012"

Although it is being sold as a new OEM Blackberry battery, allegedly the same as what comes with one's Blackberry, I don't think it is. Why? First of all, my Blackberry is only 4 months old, and its original battery is marked Made in Japan. While this battery at first glance has the same label (quite easy to fake, of course), it is actually marked Made in China. Another subtle difference is that the OEM battery that came with my Blackberry listed its milliamps (if I recall, 1400 mA). This battery has no designation at all of its amp rating. Now considering that the real thing costs $40-$50 at most cellular retail stores, and this item was one-seventh the price, what can I expect? Still, there is the little matter of false advertising...they are calling this genuine OEM.  The made in China label, the lack of a retail package (it arrived in a little plastic pouch, unmarked), and most importantly, the inferior performance, all suggest FRAUD.  Also -- they charged me [...] shipping and handling even though it was sent 1st class in a tiny envelope at a cost of about [...] at most.

As an extension and socket splitter it is OK.However they missed an essential trick on the USB power supply. If a device wants a smart USB powered device like an iPhone or iPod to see it as a high power source, and not as a data connection, it needs to short the data interface pins with a resistor not more than 200k ohms. That is in the USB spec. You can tell this hasn't been done because when you plug in an Android phone it asks if you want to mount as a media device or a hard drive.So if you are looking for a neat way to power and charge a modern smart device then this isn't it. For the 2c it would cost them for the resistors the manufacturers really should have done this.

The accessory sockets fit good and snug, it almost feels like they lock into place.

I like the idea that I can mount it with the optional tabs and screws included if I choose to. You won't be disappointed with this item.*** 9 months later, as much as I love the features and looks of this product, I am more than surprised at having to replace it due to a malfunction. I looked for what failed and found the plug used to plug into your vehicle power source had failed internally. A broken solder joint inside the plug was the issue. I considered repairing the plug but it's not possible without removing the seal around the cord where it enters the plug. I guess you could cut off the plug and wire it directly if you wanted too, BUT that's a pain! :(AWESOME RESOLUTION!

"A3IQBM4EKQC1DI","B000PCCLPA","Darthvagrant","[1, 1]","These stereo headphones are IMHO a miracle of modern electronics. (OK, maybe I'm somewhat easily impressed) I'm using them with my Samsung U900 flip shot with a 4 gig. chip..A word of caution: Your phone (or other storage device) MUST! support A2DP(Advanced Audio Distribution Profile)  and AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile) to access all the features of this device. (or for that matter, to even work with it)..I have most of my CD collection in my phone and when listening to music the buttons ON THE HEADSET will control (in the phone) fast forward, rewind, mute, move to next song, pause, and play, even  turns off the phone speaker when active. The head set is quite comfortable (at least for me). The fidelity is on par or better than plugging directly into the phone with my wired headsets. Certainly not studio quality ,but again, quite adequate.  Stereo separation is superb..I was initially concerned about the phone working with these headphones as the phone shows NO capabilities of sending stereo music (or ANY music) via bluetooth link prior to pairing with these headphones. To wit: to my Motorola H710. After pairing with the headset, all the functions magically developed in the phone of control by the headset..The only `Cons' I can think of are [1] No fidelity control (like bass and treble) [2] I haven't yet been able to INITIATE a call with the headset playing and consequently give voice orders to my phone..Which bring me to another `plus', however. When listening to music an incoming call is indicated by a tone from the headset and may easily be answered by pushing the `multifunction button' on the headset. Surprisingly, the music `mutes' and the headphones will then serve as a fairly good bluetooth hands free communication device. There is a mic in the rt. head piece as evidenced by a SMALL hole about 1mm in diameter. I didn't expect much of communication with this mic placement, but again: big surprise! It works quite well both ways during a call. Particularly on my end due to the fact BOTH ears are participating in the conversation. It isn't as good a bluetooth -phone communication device such as my Motorola H710 ear piece, but close..When the call is terminated, the music automatically comes off `mute' and again begins to play..It does take some practice to be able to push the desired button or control on the headset, as it must be done by `feel' alone. There are four different buttons, two being a `rocker' profile. Easily learned, even by this old man..Any multifunction device most always can be outdone (on a SINGLE function) by a dedicated, single use device on the plethora of functions sometimes available. A good example is my U900 Samsung flip-shot phone. It's a 3.0 megapixel camera, a passable video cam, a very good MP3 (type) player, and ,before I forget, ummmm... a very good cell phone..IMHO some of the negativity expressed in many reviews neglects to consider the INHERENT lesser capabilities of a MULTI function device. Refer to my second paragraph comment(s)..Battery life is quite good. With reasonable expectations and a compatible storage device, I think most would be satisfied with these headphones.  Emphasis on WITH A COMPATABLE A2DP/AVRCP DEVICE..Addendum 5/09- I AM able to give my phone voice commands and call initiation. This is, however, the headphones weakest feature. These headphones could stand on their flawless transmission of music alone  as far as my opinion goes. The voice commands are a non-issue for me, anyway.

"A1EE8EZLR8LJ9M","B000PCCLPA","Stephen Morrison Lewis","[1, 1]","The Sony DR BT21G is a very good piece of technology for the price.  While there may be better,  more expensive headsets on the market,  this was about as high as I was personally willing to go for something with no swappable battery and intended for serious use.I picked this up as part of a bundle with a Bluetooth Transmitter for my iPod,  and it is serviceable there.  The real shortcoming appears to be the transmitter,  which is not particularly strong.This review is strictly about the Headphones,  however,  which are pretty close to excellent.There are certain compromises purchasing headphones;  larger,  over the ear style ones are better but heavier.  Smaller,  in-the-ear style ones tend to provide less in terms of quality audio,  and are most likely worse for your ears in general.These are  street style,  which may not contour to your head if you have a larger one.  Despite this short coming,  they probably provide the best balance between size and sound.  Clip-ons always fall off my hears,  and over the ear headphones block out too much noise when I am outside.  While I appreciate my music,  I appreciate not being run over much more.The sound on these headphones is particularly good compared to a similar price range.  Use with a portable media device will depend on the transmitter;  while my iPod and transmitter struggle to broadcast from my pocket,  the headphones will receive music in fine quality from as much as 30 feet away (standard distance for a Class II Bluetooth device).  Similarly,  I can stream music from my PC anywhere in my apartment.While I did not buy this primarily with phone usage in mind,  the unit's microphone is solid and the noise cancellation is some of the best I've used.  My friends usually cannot tell if I am at home or out on the streets,  barring heavy wind or a semi driving by.  Compared to the bluetooth earpieces I've used in the past,  the reception is stellar.  Not only do I no longer have to raise my voice,  I can speak in rather quiet tones.  This was a pleasant surprise,  considering this was not the reason I made my purchase.Active Battery Life easily trumps eight hours new;  over time,  expect the batteries in a bluetooth unit will deteriorate,  and most cannot be replaced.  Expect two years of battery life from such a unit,  with some deterioration towards the end (depending on use).  Standby time is a little dodgier,  and extended time off the charger may limit usage.  If I charge the unit in the morning or overnight,  I can get a full day and change,  even with heavy use.  Unfortunately,  this appears to be the only way around the drain on the battery.The headphones also support multiple devices at once.  For example,  you can run a music device and a phone through the same unit,  provided they support the right profiles.  I stream music with an A2DP profile through my iPod or PC while also using my mobile phone.  This can cause minor disruptions to the music,  however.  Interruptions are usually minimal.  The headset features controls for fast forward,  rewind,  play/pause,  volume,  and talk/end/voice dial for phones.  A compatible device can be controlled with only the headset,  meaning your phone or music player can be tucked away and still managed.The features,  sound quality,  and reliability far outstrip any problem I have with the neckband.  If your head is larger than normal,  expect the earpieces to shift around,  and possibly discomfort if worn for several hours at a time.  When not in use,  I usually let them rest around my neck instead.The type of headphones one uses is a personal choice,  but if you prefer the street style to clip-ons,  earbuds,  and studio/monitor style over-the-ear headphones,  this is a great device for the price.","4.0","Solid product,  not intended for larger heads","1270252800","04 3, 2010"

Since it isn't on a boom it is omni-directional.

To Pause/Stop a track, it requires great concentration to feel one's way around to find this button and then manage to press straight down without moving one way or the other and thus skipping or repeating the track instead of pausing it.2. it's too close to the volume buttons. After several days of mild frustration, I've learned to slo_o_o_o_owly slide my finger up from the very bottom until I find the volume buttons. Then I slo_o_o_o_owly find the correct one to adjust up or down. Otherwise, I'm again faced with skipping to the next track every time I want to adjust the volume. This is especially unpleasant when watching Streaming movies as it generally stops the movie and forces the user to start over from the beginning and then scan to find where they were before their tragic decision to adjust the volume.This control should be moved far from other buttons. Better yet, the manufacturer could spend the extra few pennies on wire and put this control on the left earpiece where it can't be hit by accident. Of course, over there, maybe it wouldn't have to be a blasted multi-dysfunction jog button because there would be room to separate the functions to avoid unpredictable results.Overall, I love these headphones.

Being a hater of wires, I went looking for wireless headphones, and kept finding that the ones that rate well for audio quality tend to be ridiculously expensive.  I ran across these on Amazon, and decided to give them a whirl, even though they seemed too cheap (as in inexpensive, not poor quality) to be any good.I'm extremely glad I took the chance!  They have great sound, good volume, and great battery life.  I only have to charge them once a week (I listen probably only a couple hours a day, and not every day, so take that for what it's worth), which is great.  They also do a good job of isolating you from the outside world, and likewise, do a good job of keeping your tunes from bothering other people.If I had to pick out any issues with them, I'd say that they could stand to allow for bigger heads - I have them extended out as much as they will go, and they JUST fit.  I guess I am one with a big head :).The only other issue I could pick out is that the on-board controls are a little hard to pick out while wearing them - they are small, somewhat flush, and close together.  Still, I've gotten pretty adept at controlling my music with them.I have not tried them for phone calls - I tend to like to use the phone directly while at work, so I can't say how well the microphone performs.Overall, I'd say these are a great find, especially when you consider how expensive wireless headphones tend to be.

You can now change volume for the headphones using the onscreen volume sliders (previously the volume bar changed to say DRBT50 and you had to control it using the headphone controls). You also have the option to output sound to either the headphones or ipad speakers (a new toggle icon appears when the headphones are on) which is nicer than having to turn them off completely to use the ipad speakers. You can also go to next/previous song using the built-in controls. You still need to press the play/pause button for them to connect, unfortunately (other bluetooth devices connect instantly when turned on).Unfortunately, this comes with a huge downside.. videos default to playing audio through the ipad speakers. If you listen to music through the headphones and a music video comes up, the sound will come out of the ipad (you need to go into the controls and change it every time one comes up!) Even worse, other sounds such as those from games also default to the iPad speakers.. but have no option to output to the headphones (which previously worked perfectly). The downsides far outweigh the positive additions in this case, and it's something that needs to be fixed.Original review:I picked up the DRBT50 headphones for my iPad, mainly for peace of mind. I like listening to music on my iPad, but find my headphone cord always ending up in the wrong spot - getting stuck in my chair or wrapped around something. I get that If I had just rolled my chair out, the iPad would've gone crashing down feeling. Whether it's with short cords or long ones (long cords have the problem of being too long!). I wanted a wireless option that had great sound but didn't break the bank.The DRBT50 has been the closest to that, that I've found.Pairing is rather quick  (but you will need to read the manual on how to do it). Unfortunately the iPad doesn't automatically connect to it - this means that you not only need to turn the headphones on, but connect them in the Settings -> Bluetooth option. Annoying if you walk out of range or connect/disconnect the headphones all day. (UPDATE: I found that hitting the Play/Pause button on the headphones will connect it to the iPad without having to go into the options!)Battery life is very good and a charger is included - unfortunately it's an AC Adapter unlike the mini-USB port that most use.The headphones are very stylish and fold up very nicely (a big problem with the other headphones).The controls on the side are a nice idea, but more trouble than they're worth (at least to me). They're small buttons and I always find myself hitting the wrong one. Most of them will NOT work on the iPhone/iPod/iPad (only the VOL+, VOL- and Play/Pause buttons work). No big loss since the controls are so hard to find (they're behind the ear). (UPDATE: The buttons have gotten easier to find after further use - still not the easist, but definitely do-able (especially for volume)When paired with the iPad, it takes control of the volume (so you need to use the iPad to change the volume). See the product image I've attached to the item page.Sound is very good - I've heard complaints that it doesn't block out noise as good as it should (while I don't use it in the loudest places, I found it to block out most noises - not noise cancelling though). Bass could be better, but overall not bad. Not up to par with mySennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone, but it's also a third of the price and bluetooth.I would have liked a headphone input jack for those times you want to use it with a non-bluetooth device (like a home theater).I havent used it as a headset yet, but heard it does a decent job.Overall a very good product and possibly the best bluetooth headphones available in this price range. If you need something compact and high quality, and can deal with some of its oddities like the button placement, need for AC adapter and pairing issues, it's a great little addition!","4.0","Works nicely with iPad.

Obviously it isn't reasonable to expect it to come with tips, since the company doesn't know which products you own.

I have not had any problem with either popping off.  Actually, sometimes I have a hard time getting them off.I was able to fit all the pieces, including my tips, into the included travel case, but it is a tight fit.  I would have preferred some kind of zippered case to go with it.  The included case is just a pouch with two mesh pockets.  The pouch holds the charging heads, and then the cable fits in one of the pockets and tips in the other.  Since most my tips are pretty large it takes some creativity to get them all to fit.The kit is compact enough that I can throw it into my bag and not have to worry about it taking up a lot of space.  Could you imagine if I tried to carry all the chargers around for those devices?  It would be a nightmare.  That's what makes this device so useful.

In practice, I found the following problems:1. Each charger is 3 components: wall/auto unit, cable, and the tip that goes into the device and these 3 components do not fit securely, especially the cable keeps coming out of the wall or auto unit.2. The charger does not come with even one tip. So make sure you order the tip for your device along with the charger. They should have at least enclosed one common mini usb tip in the package. Charger itself is cheap but tips are very expensive - that is where they rip you off.3. You get only one cable. So you have to carry the same cable to your car and then home. Why couldn't they have 2 cables in the package? Keep one in car and one in the house.4. Build is very cheap and shows poor fabrication.5 Instead of a well made bag/box to keep 4 components, it comes with a cheap nylon bag which does not hold different tips, chargers etc snugly. They keep falling out.The result is that this product leaves you with a bad taste. I would have been better off buying 2 separate chargers -auto and wall- for $5 each from cellularfactory than paying $30 for iGo which comes with only one cable. Good concept but very poorly executed. I would not mind paying more for a well made charger with at least one common tip (mini usb), 2 cables, and a good bag/box to hold everything together.","3.0","Good Concept but Poorly Executed: each Charger is 3 Loose Components!","1201910400","02 2, 2008"

"A2BH04B9G9LOYA","B000PIT02Q","Alex P.","[34, 35]","I bought the Treo 700p to help eliminate a few gadgets so now I have my palm, MP3 and telephone all in one unit which is handy for my morning runs too.  The only thing I didn't like was having the wired headset even though the cord was long enough I kept jerking the cord during my runs pulling the ear buds out.  I needed a different solution and figured bluetooth headsets were they way but I did not want to lose stereo capabilities.  Enter the BT8010.First off, the BT8010 can be used as a one-ear mono headset like all the other BT headsets.  This is great because I can still use the headset when driving.  Unlike some of the other stereo headsets such as the Plantronics you can't wear them when driving.Then, when I need stereo for running, I just plug in the left ear unit into the mono headset.  So there is a wire but it is only behind my head connecting the left & right parts of the headset.The headset grips the ear really well so even during a run the headset stays in place.  This was what I was hoping would happen so I was very happy with the results.  And the speaker that fits into the ear is comfortable (for my ear at least).Pairing the headset to the 700p was not difficult.  In order to get stereo out of the 700p one has to download the Softick Audio Gateway which supports A2DP streaming to BT headsets.  That's just because the Treo 700p doesn't support A2DP over BT natively.Paring the headset to my Thinkpad running Windows XP Professional was painless and quick.  Now when I'm working I can stream music to my headset from the laptop and when a call comes in on the 700p it pauses the music and switches to the phone!  When I hang up on the call the headset returns to the laptop, un-pauses the music and I'm back to listening to music.  While I know most BT headsets can do this I was amazed the first time it happened.The battery life seems to be very good for my usage (40+ minute run listening to stereo plus about an hour of talk time a day).  The mono headset charges via the USB port which I connect directly to my laptop. Jabra supply a power brick for charging from a wall outlet but I don't see myself ever using it.The stereo left ear piece doesn't need charging as it picks up electricity from the mono headset via the wire.The mono headset also has volume control on it (the round silver thingy) which is nice, again for running, not having to mess with the phone to adjust the volume.I haven't had any complaints about the sound of my voice when talking on the phone.I tried to see out how far I could go from the devices and it was different for each one.  With the Treo 700p I could only go about 5-10 feet and I could hear crackling.  I could go about 20 feet from the laptop.  I was hoping to be able to go further but I guess that is just the characteristics of low powered BT.I've also tried the mono headset out in the Toyota and could hear clearly even with the noise around me.  Now I am truly wireless in all possible ways.","5.0","Works well w/Treo 700p & my laptop even when running!","1170806400","02 7, 2007"
"AVMSG0L5ARUEP","B000PIT02Q","B. Ramsey","[1, 1]","Took me a bit to figure out my phone was the sound quality issue.  Got that squared and WOW!  I really doubted the raves on the sound, but it's good.I have used a few earpieces for work without much sucess on the reciever's end (crackling and can't hear me well) and have found nobody has an issue now.Ear hook could be better as it does come apart on occasion, however, the thiness of them is a bit more comfortable than the thick ones.  I have not found a really comfortable one, that works.  This one is the better of all the one's I've tried.  I find I can pull them away from my ear a bit for comfort and still get good sound.  Stays on no matter what I'm doing.What's even better is wearing both for phone calls.  I don't find myself yelling at clients in the car through a one-piece and since it's not an in-ear you can still hear plenty around you.Battery life is awesome.  Have not had it run out all day listening to tunes and taking calls.  My phone dies quicker. Easy to switch back and forth and it does it automatically when taking calls and hanging up.Lastly, the on/off switch is real convenient for disconnecting and it syncs up much faster than any other.  I hate holding the button down to turn off and on with other ear pieces and waiting for disconnect/reconnect.If you are looking for a quality handsfree, but want the music too, this is the one.  It costs much less than a lot of others claiming great quality, unless you buy it in the store.* Following up about ear hook...do not bend to adjust for comfort, will eventually break after a few months if you do and is hard to find a replacement for less than $10.  I had to go to ebay to find as it out of stock or not available at most online cell assessory sites, including Jabra itself.  Have found the connection to be annoying to the stereo unit.  Would prefer a headset type after I've used it for some time now.** Futher followup: Replacement earpieces did not last more than a couple of months.  Finally had to chuck the whole thing and go to something else.  Trying the ICON for phone calls (fair) and went to the Nokia BH-505 Bluetooth Stereo Headset for stereo music (awesome!)","3.0","Big bang for the buck...great for phone calls too.* see comment after 1year","1213833600","06 19, 2008"

OLED Display with Battery life indicator, no more guessing how much longer you can go on a charge, not to mention telling you Charge Complete! Display also gives the options for a Call List, PHONE BOOK, and Settings.... in which are Vibrate Alert (yes, this thing can vibrate on an incoming call!), Display (which encompases Caller ID, Quiet Mode, and Brightness Controll), Wearing (which lets you chose which side the headset can be read from -right or left ear wearing), Language, Equalizer (Neutral, Rock, Pop, Jazz, Classical), Paired Devices, Factory Reset, and About (which lets you see the firmware you currently have). Yes, this thing is so detailed, you can upgrade firmware!! Download the BT8010 Controll Center to create and manage your phonebook, install a new language, and upgrade firmware.  I'm not sure how this gets any less than a 3 rating as it does FAR MORE than any other bluetooth headset I've had, and only a fraction of the price! If you can find it, there is also a stereo unit (a mini of this one) that can be hooked on via micro-usb connection in back to have stereo on music AND CALLS!

"A14IFKALTZIRSM","B000PIT02Q","Kawidood Kawidood","[1, 1]","I love this bluetooth system for three reasons.1) It can be easily switched to right or left ear, whereas I've seen other ear pieces that only work on one ear, or are difficult to change ears. This switches ears with an extremely easy adjustment.2) I love that it's the only headset that can mono or stereo depending on whether you attach the 2nd ear piece or not. ALl the other stereo headsets are always dual earpieces.3) I love that you can connect this to two devices. I have it connected to my iPod and my Motorola ZN5 and it works for the most part automatically depending on which device you're using.The sound quality is good and people I've spoken to say they can head me well with it too.Negatives:1) When connecting to my two devices, I very often had to reset the headset to get it to connect to my phone after I had used it on my iPod. Eventually I realized that it just works better when it's connected to just one device.2) The plastic piece that wraps behind the ear falls out of it's connecting hole very very easily. It's not hard to put it back in, but I wish it was planted in there better.Overall I love this bluetooth.

As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece.

"A3KEUUNAO0ATOZ","B000PIT02Q","Nicholas Ehlers Nick","[0, 0]","I purchased this Bluetooth headset as a replacement for a Motorola H700 that I had used for about 1.5 years before losing it =(Initially I was excited about the prospect of having a headset that could convert into bluetooth headphones. I used my other bluetooth all the time for work (to connect to my iPhone and my MacBook Pro) and having a stereo headset available for conference calls and product demonstrations would have been really nice. Anyhow, enough about me and my usage habits. Here's my review:3/5 stars.It's a solid product, but I experienced myriad problems trying to keep it connected to my MacBook Pro and my iPhone. Other users on Amazon have praised it's rock-solid connection, but I did not share their luck. While the pairing process itself was simple, it failed to stay connected to my MacBook for longer than 5 minutes (very annoying when you are trying to watch a product demo that is 30 minutes long and your headphones continuously cut out). I had slightly better luck with the iPhone. It would stay connected for up to 30-40 minutes (a MUST for long conference calls), but it was totally unreliable after 40 minutes (I had it drop out on two different hour long+ calls last week).Connectivity issues aside, it's a real solid performer. The call quality was excellent when connected. I was told that my voice was noticeably better (than my old Motorola bluetooth). Likewise, when I could get the headset to stay connected to my MacBook Pro, the stereo audio was more than acceptable for a bluetooth connection. It even had more base than I was expecting.Battery life is also quite good. I was using it nearly 3 hours a day between calls and computer usage and I only found myself charging it every 3-4 days.Another nice feature is the screen. I know it seems silly to have a screen on something that is attached to your head most of the time you are using it, but I really underestimated the utility. I actually stopped carrying my phone around the office and just took the headset. I could see caller ID, check bluetooth battery life, and even dial from the (small, but amazing for a bluetooth headset) internal phonebook.The one serious issue besides the connectivity that I had with it was how it sat on my ear. It takes a while to figure out how to put it on (HINT: when you put it on, swivel the ear hook towards the front end of the ear piece, put it next to your ear, and swivel the hook back over your ear like you're locking handcuffs). It's important to note that you shouldn't try to fit the little speaker unit inside your ear (even though it TOTALLY seems like it should go in). If you follow my hint above to put it on, the speaker will just sit outside your ear comfortably. If you try to fit it inside your ear, there is a little nub that will poke the inside of your ear and begin to hurt after just 1-2 minutes of use!!!All told, this is a great headset if you can get it to connect. As Mac/iPhone user, I had a helluva time. I'll still use it as a back up. I mean, c'mon, $20 for a stereo bluetooth headset? That's just a crazy good deal. But I will be getting another headset that is more reliable.As a side note, I never once in the entire 1.5 years of using it, lost connection with my Motorola H700 (for any reason other than the battery dying while it was on). In the week that I've had the Jabra BT8010, I've lost connection 23 times (that I remembered to count).I recommend this as a buy to any PC/non-iPhone user (or any Mac/iPhone user who is a glutton for punishment).One more thing.

Of course now it has come down in price drastically and became too good of a purchase to pass on.The order arrived early and my only complaint with the seller is that they repackaged the headset.This device works great as a hands free driving device and if you want to listen to music you just attach the external ear speaker.  Because it can be use both ways is one of the reasons why I bought it.The fit can be a problem if you do not like the hook over your ears and you may have to spend some time adjusting the device each time you put it on so that it is at least tolerable if not comfortable.  This goes for the main unit and the external ear speaker.  Do not be afraid to try each unit on your other ear as it may give a more comfortable fit.The sound is good and will keep you entertained but if you are a an audiophile use a good wired headset.  While the sound is good it is at times tinny and missing the base.  Considering though this is a device you wear out on the street, the background noise is probably ruining your perception of the sound anyway.This is a great device and considering how much it costs is a great value.

"ADLVFFE4VBT8","B000PYJ4NK","A. Dent Aragorn","[1, 1]","Briefly, the BT5020 Headset is Bluetooth 2.0 compliant and it is compatible with Bluetooth 1.1 or higher devices. It was easy to pair with a cell phone and we experienced no major issues using it. My wife, a heavy phone users was able to wear and talk trough the BT5020 for hours without experiencing any discomfort.With one exception which I will discuss below all the specs listed in the Amazon's fact sheet are accurate and I see no reason to retype them as part of this review. I should add that the BT5020 'remembers' up to 8 paired devices and, according to the manufacturer, it can sustain connections with 2 devices at the same time. I did not test this feature.What you get:- The Bluetooth headset itself.- 110-220V charger- Short USB (Type A/Micro-B) cable for charging off a computer.- Small Quick Start Guide with graphic illustrations showing buttons, pairing and how to wear it.- 2 silicone gel earplugs to be used with the headset.What I liked:- Comfortable wear.- Light weight.- Long battery life.- Short charge time.- Flexible charging options (charger or off a PC via USB)- Relatively good quality sound - I did read the other reviews but my wife is very pleased with the sound quality and she's a heavy, constant user.Issues:- Lacks a storage case.- There seems to be no way to replace the headset vibrating on incoming calls with maybe a beep. My wife likes the vibration feature but I can't stand it and I would have rejected this if it was for me.- Seems to be a subset of a Jabra product with one essential component missing (see below).Unbundled item:The Amazon page states lists among features the following:Multipoint connections, allowing simultaneous connection to phone and PC and The headset features Jabra's Multipoint connection functionality, enabling it to be connected to two devices at the same time--such as a PC and a phone, or music player and phone.The above apply to a product named Jabra BT5020 Multiuse WITH BLUETOOTH HUB. I could NOT find a listing for the plain BT5020 at the Jabra Web site, indicating that the product was either discontinued or that this 'exec package' offer is not part of the official Jabra product line. For THAT product (Multiuse with Bluetooth Hub), the specs page states correctly that It connects wirelessly to your Bluetooth mobile phone and simultaneously to your corded desk phone via a discreet Bluetooth hub for ultimate convenience and ease of use with none of the hassle of changing headsets.It should be well understood that this package does NOT include the Bluetooth Hub.Rating:As Bluetooth headsets go, this is a good one and my wife will keep it. I will subtract 2 stars for the lack of a case and the unnecessary confusion created by the inaccurate claim of it being able to be paired to 2 devices simultaneously.","3.0","Above average Bluetooth headset, some confusion concerning features","1249689600","08 8, 2009"

I've walked at least 20 feet away from my phone before I heard any crackling. It even worked well when I went outside the room.I've never had a BT headset before but I had heard that you really need to have an In-The-Ear type of earpiece for you to hear anything above a silent room. I thought I might not like the fact that this unit didn't have an gel earpiece. I do use a custom-fitted earpiece in my job to monitor audio so I know what it's like to depend on one. But I found that this one worked very nicely without one. I was able to hear quite well in my car and other noiser vehicles. It also doesn't completely block out the surrounding noise when it's not in use. It does come with a directional condom like device but found that it was not necessary even in a loud, bare walled, cargo van (which is pretty noisy on a freeway).The fit is nice. While I do know that I have it on. It may become less noticable as I use it further. It took litle practice to get to the point of slipping it on my ear with one hand in less than a few of seconds.I think I would have preferred the buttons (at least the answer/end or volume buttons) on the side of the unit rather than the edges but I'll get used to them eventually.I haven't tested the mic in windy conditions yet but in a typical situation inside and outside the audio seemed good considering the mic is no where near my mouth. I'm not sure how it will perform when I have more ambient sound when I make a call though I've not had a problem when I used it in a grocery store.I haven't used it long enough to comment on quality of build. I hoping I can take a beating though it does seem somewhat delicate.I wish the charging port was mini USB but it's even smaller than that. Like a submini USB port if there is such a thing. It does come with a USB charging cable and fortunately I had a cigarette lighter plug with a USB port built in so I can attach the cable and charge it in my car. Unfortunately the cable is only 12 inches long so attaching it while driving isn't easy.Overall, I like the design, fit and sound. It does deserve the bad rap it got since I experienced it on my wife's phone but for me it's a great device that works nicely.","3.0","Works for me but not for wife","1186444800","08 7, 2007"

"ASHMKDJI9Q3K4","B000Q5J2M6","K. Gehrke","[5, 5]","My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.","5.0","Can you buy a better headset?

The first one developed a crack right on the seam after less than a year of use (I didn't drop it). I tried super glue but the glue may have gotten into the circuitry because the microphone stopped working.Overall, the headset feels flimsy and if you grip it too tightly, it will crack. However, we all want a lightweight headset...so maybe I shouldn't complain. The Scala picks up all outgoing calls automatically after you dial the # on your cell phone. However, you have to press the button on the Scala after picking up incoming calls. This results in a 2-3 second delay...an eternity if you've got another person on the line saying hello? hello?.It's got its drawbacks but it's the only headset that works consistently with my Treo 650.","4.0","Works well with Treo 650","1202860800","02 13, 2008"

I only recently replaced my 500 (battery gave out after a couple years hard usage and it wouldn't hold a charge) with a 700, which I loved--until it made an unscheduled trip through the washing machine.  The 700LX is nearly identical to the 700, with one added improvement.  The earpiece on the 700LX, unlike the base 700, has a much stiffer wire for custom fit.  This way when you get it to fit, it is more likely to fit AFTER you mash it around in your pocket.  Another great feature is turning off the blue blinky LED, so you can be a bit more disreet when calling.  It has a bunch of other features, too many to list but most are useful.

"A2DNID0AN8FPUO","B000Q6R4MK","Jonathan Stauffer Jonathan","[7, 7]","I bought this speaker phone about 3 months ago. I used this speakerphone successfully with the original Motorola Razor and now the iPhone 3G. If you don't want to read my detailed review, then just read the short Pros and Cons section.CNETs review of the speaker phone is accurate:[...]Cons:1. Speakerphone has slightly squishy volume buttons.2. Protruding antenna could possibly break if handled carelessly.3. Flashing blue light.Detailed Explanation1. CNET says speakerphone has slightly squishy buttons. This refers to the volume buttons on top of the unit. I didn't think this would be a big deal, but I noticed that it was hard to know if the volume button was actually pressed. There was no click or anything like that. As a result, the volume button ended up breaking because I was probably applying a little too much pressure. No worries though, Amazon has an excellent product return service and you don't have to pay for the shipping. They ship you a new product immediately and then you have some time to ship the broken product back to Amazon. I received the new speakerphone first and then I shipped the one that broke. Excellent service from Amazon, but remember to keep your box and shipping papers for a little while so that you can use those in case of a return.  I contacted Blueant support, but they were going to make me pay for the return shipping. The moral of this story is to go easy on the volume button, even when you don't notice that the volume is increasing at first.2. I've had no problems with the antenna. However, I can see that it may be susceptible to breaking if you're not somewhat careful when turning the unit on/off. I suggest using two hands when your turning it on/off. Slowly push the antenna in all the way until you hear a click sound and then you're done.It's actually kind of nice because the microphone on the antenna is protected from the environment (like dust) when the speakerphone is off.3. To be honest, I don't notice this at all (even during the night). The light is NOT bright. I have a scion TC car and the speakerphone is pretty close to my head (compared to a large SUV or truck). It still doesn't bother me at all. Don't put too much stock in reviews that tell stories of a blue light menace. If for some reason it does bother you at night, then you may consider flipping your visor down so that the speakerphone is between the window and the visor. This will block the light. If somebody calls, then flip the visor back.Pros1. Excellent sound quality. Noise and echo cancellation works great. Very clear.2. Full duplex.3. Very loud.4. Extremely long battery life.5. Great for conference calls.6. Fast connection to bluetooth compatible phone. Works great with iPhone 3G.7. The black device looks very nice.1. The sound quality is superb. Most of the time people don't even know that I'm in the car. However, the sound quality is limited to the sound quality of your phone. If you are having major problems with the sound quality, then test the speakerphone on multiple phones. Most likely the problem is with your phone and not the speakerphone. Another IMPORTANT note: the microphone on the antenna must be within about a 45 degree angle of your head to get the best results. For example, if the speaker phone is on top of your head, then obviously you won't get as good of sound compared to the speakerphone being in front of you. The directions that come with the phone show a diagram of where the speakerphone should be relative to your head for best results.2. Full duplex means that if two conversations overlap, then both people will be able to hear what the other is saying. This makes conversations more natural. If you don't have full duplex (like the motorola speakerphone doesn't have it), then it leads to some awkward conversations because only one voice gets through when conversations slightly overlap.3. The speakers can be turned up very loud. No problem hearing your phone calls. No need to get a speakerphone that connects to your car stereo. This speaker is loud. The speaker is better than most speakerphones out there.4. The battery life can easily last a month even when you are using it almost every day. It comes with an A/C adapter charger and a car charger.5. I work from home sometimes and use the speakerphone for conference calls. It works great. I can be typing on my computer and talking to somebody as if they were right there. The noise and echo cancellation makes this a better alternative to using a regular home phone speakerphone or cell phone speakerphone.6. Follow the directions the first time you setup a connection between the speakerphone and your cell phone. After that, all you have to do is get into your car and turn on the bluetooth speakerphone and it will automatically connect to your cell phone. This works for both the motorola razor and the iPhone 3G phone. For the iPhone 3G, you have to make sure that that the bluetooth is on. Then turn on the speakerphone, and the connection will be automatic.7. The speakerphone is small and sleek looking.Should I buy this one or the or the new Blueant supertooth light bluetooth speakerphone III?The speakerphone III is a good speakerphone, but I recommend this one. The speakerphone III speaks the caller's name when they are calling you. The voice sounds like a machine and doesn't flow very well. I listened to a youtube videos of it. If I really need to, I can tell who is calling me just by taking a glance at my phone. In short, I decided that the extra money for the speakerphone III isn't worth the new features. This speakerphone has the important quality features that you are looking for at a value price.","4.0","Pros and Cons plus details if needed","1236384000","03 7, 2009"

Speakerphone is fairly powerful for such a small package but the sound is not always crystal clear. Listeners at the other end sometimes complain of muffled voice. Still, it is better than using the cell phone itself next to your ear.Pairing with cell phone is very easy and the animated guides at Blueant's web site are very helpful. Battery life is amazingly long, sometimes lasting a month! It sticks very securely to the magnetic attachment for the visor. Customer service was fairly helpful, but not outstanding, took 3 weeks to replace my dead Supertooth II.

I don't know if that's because I upgraded to a Motorola Droid 2, or what.  But I always get 2 to 3 bars at my desk now, so I don't really need it any more anyway.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, I'm pleased with the zBoost YX300 zPersonal Cell Phone Signal Booster unit, which I purchased to help with signal strength in my home office.  It makes a definite difference.  Not huge, but big enough to meet my needs, and well worth the price.I work out of my home office, and use my cell phone (currently a Palm Centro on Verizon) at my desk regularly.  Standing out on my sidewalk, I get three bars.  In most of my house, I get 2 bars.  For whatever reason, sitting at my desk I would occasionally get two bars, but usually only one and sometimes none.  After adding the zBoost, I always get two bars at my desk, which is a critical difference.  I had hoped that I would get 4 bars at my desk, but that didn't materialize. But I'll settle for always having at least two bars, because now my calls don't drop and my voice quality is good.I found the setup pretty straightforward, with the exception of the suction cups on the antenna end not sticking very well, even to a slick surface.  I solved that problem with an adhesive cable tie base, attaching the antenna to it with a couple of plastic cable ties.  Fortunately, the suction cups on the base unit stick to the glass just great.It is crucial to observe the distances specified in the instructions, which are pretty scanty, on the back of the box.  My base unit is stuck to the window at approximately the same height as the antenna (about five feet up), and the two are ten feet apart, give or take a couple of inches, and have a clear line of sight between them.  I sit midway between the two, i.e., five feet from each.  Both base and antenna are vertically oriented, if that makes any difference.  The idiot light on the base is always green.It is also crucial to connect the antenna cable to the base first, and only then plug in the power. The light will be red, and stay that way for ten or fifteen minutes while the unit acquires signal towers, etc.  Once it turns green, you can accurately guage the results.So, just three stars, because I had hoped for more bars, but the ones I got have made a critical difference to me.  I would recommend this device to anyone with similar needs - just keep your expectations modest.","3.0","Pretty good performance, makes a critical difference, delivers value","1257206400","11 3, 2009"

My office does not have an outside wall, and I was getting zero to 1 bars without it. When I first installed this, I was able to find a location next to the ceiling where I had two bars consistently. I located the window unit there, but even though my phone showed 2 or 3 bars, my calls broke up severely.A few days ago, I put the window unit above the ceiling, where I had three bars, and it started working. However, the only way it works is if I leave my phone sitting next to the antenna, and use my bluetooth. If I move my phone as little as 6 away I go to 0-1 bars. Any farther and I have no bars.My other big problem is that if the antenna is too close to the window unit, there is a back feed, and it stops working. That wouldn't be a huge problem, except the wire isn't all that long, and once you run it down the wall, and across the room, it is nearly impossible for it not to pick up the antenna and it stops working. Since installing it in the ceiling this problem went away, but I can no longer run the wire all the way to the floor and over to my desk. It looks pretty bad, and it may cause me problems with my boss. I wish I could add another 12-20 feet so I can install it neatly.Bottom line. If you don't have at least 3 bars where you locate the window unit, and you can't leave your phone sitting next to the antenna, then I would recommend you stay away from this item. One other comment is that I think it should be designed to work the other way around. The black antenna should mount on the window and the main unit should be located near the phone. Running both power and the antenna wire into the ceiling or to a window is just plain stupid. But, for $50 it is working for me, and I'm happier than I was.","3.0","Works for me, but just barely.","1286928000","10 13, 2010"

You setup the main box in the area that gets coverage (for instance the main floor of your house), and the remote antenna in the nearby area that does not (basement, garage). The remote antenna attaches to the main box with a thin 20' antenna wire. The manufacturer recommends that both devices be separated by at least 10'.Plug the antenna into the main box, plug in the power, you're done: you're now getting cell coverage in your basement.At least, that's the theory; when I initially received my YX300, I couldn't make any sense out of it, and it just didn't work. A red light was always blinking on it no matter what I did. The manual (a few lines of instructions printed on the back of the box) was completely unhelpful.The YX300 I received had other problems: one of the suction cups on the main box was damaged, and one of the suction cups on the remote antenna was broken right out of the box. I contacted customer support and requested a replacement (a painless process, they were very responsive).Now that I have received the replacement, I understand why the reviews are either 5-stars or 1-star: the device I initially received was completely defective. The replacement worked flawlessly right out of the box.The YX300 is inexpensive, easy to setup and works well. Unfortunately, its reputation is marred by bad reviews because of serious quality control issues. Don't hesitate to request a replacement if yours doesn't work as expected.

I had to practically hang my head out of a window to talk longer than 1 minute. After doing some serious research, I decided this was the most inexpensive solution that didn't require a physical connection to my cell phone.There are 2 pieces - a larger unit that is placed in a window and attached to the glass via 2 suction cups and a plastic antenna that connects to the unit via a long cord and also has 2 suction cups on the back. The window unit is powered by the included power supply, so you need to place it in a window that has an electrical outlet nearby.The only instructions are on the back of the box - just 3 steps. Personally, I would have appreciated a little more in the way of set-up and troubleshooting instructions, hence my 4 star rating.Be ready to spend some time figuring out the best location for the unit and the antenna. A lot depends upon where the nearest tower is and what kind of obstructions are between you and it. I put mine in a couple of different windows before I hit on the one with the best reception. Then, you need to place the antenna at least 10 feet from the window where the amplifier is. That entails figuring out how to run the long antenna cable so that it isn't in the way. Right now, I have the antenna attached to the glass on some artwork but I will probably glue or tack the suction cups to the wall when I am sure I like where it's located.The unit in the window has an LED that glows green or red. If you place the antenna too close to the amplifier, it flashes red to indicate it's not working. When you move the antenna, you will need to unplug the amplifier and then plug it back in so it will reset itself and tell you if the amplifier is far enough away.Lastly, you must be within 6 feet of the antenna for it to work properly. That in itself requires careful thought as to the placement of everything. You want it to be in an area you are comfortable taking all of your calls from.That's it. When you get everything set up, it will work to amplify whatever signal you normally get. (Note - if you had no signal before, this will not give you a signal. It only amplifies what signal you already have.) I noticed immediate improvement. My calls don't have a lot of drop outs now and the call doesn't drop after a minute or two. The call quality is very good, also. Of course, I must stay within 6 feet of the antenna, but for $60, I can live with that.","4.0","Inexpensive solution that works for me","1255996800","10 20, 2009"

The black barrel is classic and subtle.This is a really nice stylus. The barrel is a satin finish anodized aluminum that is the same diameter as most pens (my frame of reference is the Bic plastic barrel hotel pens). The stylus is a little shorter than those standard pens.The tip is really satisfying. There is just enough firm sponge feel and a little bit of drag on the screen. The ball is large enough that it is pretty hard to nick the screen with that silver metal end cap. Response is excellent on my original iPad and iPhone 4s, both have screen protectors.I'm not a huge fan of the pocket clip. It is a sharp metal clip that really doesn't work with my shirt pockets. Since I'll likely never put it in a pocket, that doesn't bother me at all.There is a dizzying array of ways to attach this to the iDevice. The key is a little tiny black plastic thingie that gets jammed in the headphone jack. On the stylus side there is a small key ring where the lanyards attach. There are three different kinds of attachment devices; a strange looking plastic spring; a string; and a string with a ring on it. None of these are long enough to use the stylus while attached to an iPad (they work great with an iPhone). One end of the attachment devices has a necklace style clasp attached to it. That allows fairly easy removal of the stylus while leaving the base attached to the headphone jack.Overall, this is an excellent stylus at a good price.

On top of it all, I spent a good $16.99 for it with no additional features worth mentioning except that it had a clip on it just like any other pocket pen.I looked around Amazon and came across this pen.  I was intrigued by the fiber mesh construction at the tip.  I was, however, a little wary about the price that it was going for, especially seeing that it was nearly half what I paid.My fears proved to be unfounded.  The fiber mesh construction at the end is more than just a gimmick; it works.  Just the feel of the construction at the tip makes me feel pretty reassured that this pen is going to last me quite a bit longer than the other pen.  I have tried it on both my daughter's Samsung Tab 2 and my Kindle Fire HD and they both respond instantly and fluidly to the pen's touch with no interruptions/stuttering.Included with the pen are 3 lanyard attachments.  Two of them feature 3.5 mm jack plug-ins...you can use the headphone jack of your tablet to secure your pen if you feel inclined.  It works, but I worry about the plastic construction of the jack insert.  Although it has not happened, I fear that if something were to snap off the cord, then fishing that piece of plastic out of the 3.5 mm jack would lead to a not-so-fun day.  The third just has rings at either end.  Personally, I don't find myself needing any of them, since I don't find myself in a situation where I need to just have it dangling off the end.  I either use the spine of my cover and the pen clip or, in the case of my daughter's case, use the fabric loop that is designed to hold a pen.I highly recommend this pen - great construction, smooth performance, and eye-catching colors to match whichever tablet or tablet case you may have.","5.0","Very responsive and durable","1358208000","01 15, 2013"

I think this is a rubber-tipped stylus with a microfiber cover.  The microfiber definitely makes it more responsive.  I use an ipad note taking program every business day, and my other styli had a problem where sometimes it just wouldn't pick up the writing stroke and I'd have to use my finger. This gets picked up almost every time.  In fact, I've encountered one program not picking up my finger, but it did pick up on this stylus.Its also a good length and circumference - like a real pen, although a little more heft would be nice.  The attachments are nice, but I don't think I'll use them.Only minor drawback, and this may be due to my use of a no glare screen protector, is that there is a rubbing. Lise as I write.  Not that big a deal, but I'd prefer silence and my rubber tipped styli are silent.  Still, this registers much easier so ill be sticking with it.1-6-14:  The stylus is starting to skip.  I have not regularly used this stylus for several months now, as I've been using the similar product that I bought from friendly swede on June 2013 instead.  I purchased the product from the friendly Swede because it was cheaper and I intended to use them as my backups, but they just sort of became my primary stylus for no particular reason. The boxwave is definitely harder to use, as the ipad is not picking it up as easily.  I assume the rubber underneath the microknit is drying out, but I am not sure.  I would not view this as a warning or a drawback to this product; just be aware that the life expectancy of the stylus is about 2 years. At least for this one.  I don't know that the ones by the friendly swede or anyone else will last longer.","5.0","Really good stylus","1355443200","12 14, 2012"

Many of us leave these energy vampires - like VCRs, DVDs, cell phone chargers and other things, plugged in all day long. They drain our electricity and rack up our electrical bills! How can you know how much money they cost you? The answer is the Kill-A-Watt device!P3 P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor Operation of this device is VERY easy. You lug the Kill-a-watt into your power outlet. Then you plug your electronic toy into the Kill-A-watt! That's it! Instantly the device starts figuring out how much electricity the electronic object is using - EVEN WHEN IT IS OFF. A lot of devices like cell phone chargers sit there drawing electricity all day long.For example, I leave my laptop plugged in all day. I have it shut down - but it's plugged in. It turns out I'm paying $3.76 a month to have it sitting there. I know that might not sound like a lot, but if you start multiplying that by all the other objects in your house that stay plugged in, it can add up quickly.Just how much is that old computer of yours costing you? It might actually be MUCH cheaper to buy a new one that consumes far less electricity, rather than powering the old behemoth every month! You could be amazed at the amount of money you can save, just by unplugging some things when they're not in use. Invest in some power strips with on-off buttons. Turn them to OFF when the items are not in use, and see your savings soar.I love that you can program in your current electrical cost - this is always found on your electrical bill. So for my home in Massachusetts that is $0.187 per kwh. The device then lets you see - at the touch of a button - how much the current object will cost you each hour, each day, each month, each year. The longer you leave the specific item plugged in, the more perfect your reading is, as it averages the device's fluctuations over day and night.HIGHLY recommended. This is perfect for any frugal liver, to determine exactly what devices in their homes are energy hogs and to organize what to do about it.","5.0","Super Easy, Great Money Saving Device","1233273600","01 30, 2009"

"ALUTHT4U058KZ","B000RGF29Q","M. M. Jackson","[2, 2]","We got ours last night and got down to business. Serious home-economics business. The big ones I was worried about were entertainment center with Wii, stereo, etc. on idle, a laptop station in another room that is often left on and then finally I just installed a window A/C unit in our bedroom to avoid paying for all-night whole-house A/C when we are only in one room (childless couple as you may have imagined).Anyhow, the entertainment center turned out to be costing us something like $15...per year. A buck and change a month. Not worth the hassle of fooling with, but I did put the Wii, amp, preamp and various disc players on a single switch on our uber-power supply in order that we can squelch even that.I did some preliminary stuff around the house...lots of stuff like *newer* cell phone chargers draw almost literally nothing. I think it was $1.76 per YEAR *when charging* for our cell phone chargers...a pittance at cents a month. When phones are not plugged in, our chargers drew only LED power...i.e. unregisterable as it was less than one-tenth of a cent an hour.So...mostly just confirmation that a lot of the potential vampires out there really aren't.BUT...WOW...in some cases, you must be careful...We stuck our Bunn coffeemaker in the thing. The numbers started ratcheting up...fifty dollars per year...seventy...one hundred and twenty...one hundred and fifty... OH MY GOODNESS...The Kill A Watt EZ works on averaging over time, I realized we had *just* turned this thing on and it was going from cold to heat water up - QUICK! mode...in other words, drawing lots of power. That said, while Bunn coffeemakers I believe make the best tasting coffee and quick, they do the quick part of that by leaving the water heater on standby mode, always heating the water up as it cools.Naturally, I have always wondered about how much that sucker costs per year. I think I will feed it some water and let it run for a few days to get an averaged yearly cost. Should be interesting and if Amazon lets me I will report back.Secondly, another issue: I plugged this thing into our turned-off Oster blender...this is one of the classic vintage style blenders, if that matters at all...and it was reporting something like $4.75 per month, IDLE. Weird.Then, after a bit, that number started dropping...and dropping...and dropping.Perhaps when it first starts, there is some big surge that runs through it that was taking a while to be diluted by the draw-per-minute averaging in the Kill A Watt EZ.Anyhow, I really think that thing uses nothing when plugged in and idle.*** The important point to the blender example is that there will be a temptation to perform quick-hit analyses on your appliances, but this is not always the best strategy. This thing will give an accurate yearly cost for something that draws consistently, but anything that has a weird spike when first plugging it in or that turns on and off in terms of draw, like a Bunn coffee maker's water heater or a window A/C unit that blows cheap fan constantly, but turns on it's power-consuming compresser here and there must be left on for a while to get that averaging going. That is the only way you'll get an accurate and realistic actual-use cost. ***Microwave was also basically nothing year-long when not in use...I think it was one dollar a year, maybe. It was apparently just powering it's little calculator-style LCD display, and that was it. The power gets sucked during cooking, but how many minutes per day are you doing that?A floor fan costed $11...per year...to run continuously. The way we were using it, it was probably costing us $4.50 a year...and to think I used to get upset if one of us left it on all day. HA!My InFocus projector (800x600 DLP projector) draws 1 cent per hour. Well, wow, that shocked me. I left that on for a while and it still reported 1 cent per hour. Good stuff! I am sure they will come out with LED projectors that use 1 cent per 10 hours, but until that time, I have no good reason to switch or upgrade...power is cheap.(Oh, forgot to mention, power is 12 cents per kWh where I live at the moment...price your own accordingly).Oh, that window A/C unit is - I think  - about 8,000 BTU and  came in at thirty-six cents per night. I am sure our A/C for the house was running at least dollar a night, judging by our bill, so this should save us 60% (36 cents instead of a buck) of about half of our bill (since 8 hrs we use A/C wall unit, 8 hrs we use whole-house and 8 hrs it is OFF completely during the day when we are gone). So 30% savings right off the bat...and that will pay for the A/C wall unit very quickly.In the final analysis, there wasn't much adjustment made. This thing did not really directly pay for itself monetarily, but in terms of peace-of-mind, it definitely helped. I think our major expense is air conditioning, and after two months of our bill jumping over 50%, I am hoping the use of the window unit solves our energy crisis. I sure couldn't find anything else (plugged in anyways, hardwired is another story) that seemed to draw anywhere near significant amounts of power.The Kill A Watt EZ was worth it for me as a peacemaker - both with myself and with my wife. The peace-of-mind was easily worth the thirty bananas it costed, and the hour-day-month-week-year calculations are WELL worth the ten or twelve more bones you pay for the EZ model over the regular P4400...if I had to do it all over again, I'd still pick the P4460...well worth the hassle savings. The criticisms about it being hard-to-read and the solution to stick it on an extension cord (I used a power strip, which was perfect as it was short and highly portable versus a big bulky three-prong extension cord) are both spot on.Well done, P3, for a great product. Our vampire hunt didn't turn up any convincing vampires, but it did ease our minds about them and allowed us to better focus our energy saving...well...energies.","5.0","Five Star, But You'll Find More Positive Status Quo Than Negative","1282089600","08 18, 2010"
"AEWYUPCNDV7HY","B000RGF29Q","Modern Blue Argonaut No I do not have a shoe...","[43, 45]","I have been able to trim my average $224 monthly utility bill to about $125 per month by converting to 100% CF light bulbs, even above bathroom vanities, and in overhead and outdoor spotlighting. I was very happy to see my bill drop by about $25-30 a month on an annual comparison basis. Next, we started unplugging and turning off fans and lights that were not being used and then turning the thermostat up a degree.I added double layer window treatments as well to keep the heat out. Every improvement had paid for itself and sheer curiosity led to the P3 International Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor.I plugged the power strip for my home entertainment center into this after plugging in my local utility rate, and then sat by with bated breathe waiting for the initial estimate. Nothing came through. I found out that this needed to run for at least a couple of days before it would come up with a number. Once I got a number I left it plugged in for a month and then checked again. Overall, I was very pleased. We have a 42 HDTV, HD-DVD player, xbox 360, stereo receiver with two speakers, Cable box, CD player, and a Squeezebox Duet system. Annually, the total cost is $54. I felt that was very reasonable, and it was nice to have a number. Next I plan to plug it into a lamp, and since all of our lamps are using the same bulb, I will be able to get a very good estimate of their annual (average) cost of operation as well.If you're a big numbers person, or are looking to find ways to reduce your energy cost, this could lead you in the right direction, and it's a fun gadget to have.Cons: screen is not too bright, and if you have it plugged in low behind things, it's hard to get to and read. Solution: buy a power strip liberator.I think that the power companies should rent and/or loan these out to their customers (with a deposit of course). They're always trying to get people to use less energy, and this could be an affordable eye opener.","5.0","Now I know what various things cost to run!","1213747200","06 18, 2008"

"ADLVFFE4VBT8","B000ROGDNM","A. Dent Aragorn","[0, 0]","This has been my longest lasting holster for a Blackberry, so far. Over 2 years and counting.To me, 'wearing' a Blackberry is second-nature, having had one attached to may waist for more than 10 years now, so I may be as good as getting my Blackberry in an out if its holster as a gunslinger is with his gun. There's a lot I like about this holster and here I'm putting it down in a list:- makes it easy to get the Blackberry out or lock it in quickly- professional-looking black leather- the rubberized sides make it hold the BB tight- strong magnetic locking - VERY strong, really- swivel is okay, makes it easier to clip/unclip the holster- solid, strong build - like I said, I've been wearing this one almost daily for more than 2 years and it doesn't show signs of breaking or cracking yetTwo so-so or interesting remarks. First, I agree with another reviewer that it's not so friendly to love handles. I can't say that I have them but, in the summer, when my employer (thank you employer) allows me to dress very casually, the clip sometimes presses into my skin. This is not a problem at all during other seasons because I have something tucked in my pants then so the clip does not touch the skin directly. Secondly, it's the magnetic lock. It's so strong, it will pick up small metallic objects such as paperclips and even larger ones if they happen to be near.Overall, I am happy with this holster and I'm likely to be using it for a while longer. It's a 5-star.","5.0","Well built, keeps the Blackberry in safe, makes it easy to get it out","1251331200","08 27, 2009"
"AIFLY2HF8NS8U","B000ROGDNM","Andre Lawrence","[0, 0]","I just upgraded my Blackberry from the 7100 to the Curve Titanium (TMO).  I wanted to protect this investment and, as usual, I like to get critical feedback from people whom actually have the product and can attest to its value.After purchasing the swivel case and screen protector, here's my initial observation for the past two weeks.Excellent.  The case was a better cover that the one supplied by Blackberry.  The magnet encased arm snaps and hold the phone snuggly in place.  Some times, I twirl the phone around in my hand, just to see where gaps would form.  The combination of the magnetic strap and the elastic sides keeps the phone in place securely.I had to resolve an annoying problem that evident with the phone itself and not with the accessories: slippage.  With the 7100, the design had a loop at the bottom of the phone where you could (and I did!) rig a wrist strap.  I looped the wrist strap into the old 7100 case and it never fell out.  That's part of the reason I had the 7100 for 4 years.However, there is no place to put a wrist strap on the Curve so, I bought a skin.  Well, how does the skin work with the holster and screen guard?Perfectly!  The black skin and the black leather holster really enhances the look and the feel of the phone (too bad it's not 3G!.)  With regard to earlier commentators dislike for it-- I found the phone to fit more snuggly.  The difference between having and not having the skin on in the holster is negligible at best.  In fact, it's an added benefit because if you put the phone down and it falls off the table on to whatever surface--think the concrete surface outdoor-- if that phone falls diagonally, you will see a dent or a crack in the phone.  Having the skin on prevents that.About the belt clip being useless--NONSENSE!  It has a very strong spring. You want it to be tight so the phone and the holster itself won't spring off when you bump against something or someone.  Taking mass transit here in Miami, I can attest to phone clips popping off while rushing in and out of trains.This leather holster is a good deal whether you buy other accessories for the Curve or not.","5.0","Blackberry Curve Leather Swivel Case: It's a good deal: A Critical Review","1231718400","01 12, 2009"

"A2BMZRO0H7TFCS","B000ROO28K","Ed","[61, 63]","The Samsung WEP410 bluetooth headset performs remarkably well, is reasonably easy to use and is comfortable to wear for short periods of time.  With the rebate making this headset well under $[...], it's a fantastic value.  It is not however, without some problems.PROS:- Excellent sound quality on both ends- Good battery life- Good build quality- Good range- Very small- Good looks- Multiple ear gel sizesCONS:- Redial button too easy to activate accidentally- Cannot charge without charging case- No multipoint connectionI have an old Logitech Mobile Freedom bluetooth headset I purchased nearly two years ago. With the upcoming law that prohibits the use of cell phones without hands-free devices, I needed a 2nd headset for our 2nd car. I figured I could leave a headset in each car and both my wife and I would always have a headset to use regardless of driver or car. I found out that my old headset does not support multiple pairings (Multipoint) and neither does the Samsung WEP410.  At the incredible after rebate price however, I was willing to give it a shot anyways.FITThis has to be the most important aspect of the headset, in my opinion. My old Logitech headset fit great, but did take some time to get used to.  Because the earpiece actually goes inside the ear, it is easy to put on and take off with one hand.  It's not quite comfortable enough for me to just leave it in there all day.  I've not tried using the other ear gels to see if they may be more comfortable than the one that was already on the headset out of the box.CALL QUALITYI can hear very well while in the car and so far nobody has asked me to repeat myself.  They have said that they could not tell I was using a headset.BATTERY & CHARGINGThe WEP410 comes with a handy plastic carrying case that doubles as a charger.  It took less than 2 hours to completely charge, which is half the time it takes for me to charge my Logitech headset. The battery life of about 4 hours talk-time is more than enough for my limited use and I have yet to recharge it in the 3 weeks I've been using it.  Be careful with the case however.  If you lose it, you will not be able to charge your headset.BUTTONSThere are only 3 buttons on this tiny headset.  The main multi-function button is a good size and the two volume buttons are very small.  The volume buttons are pretty difficult to press at first but after some use, you'll get the hang of it.  I was also dumbfounded as to why the volume UP button would be on the bottom of the headset rather than the top until I realized it is because I wear the headset on my right ear.  If I put it in my left ear, the UP button would indeed be on the top.  The multi-function button allows you to pair your headset, answer/end calls, redial, and activate voice-dialing.  Samsung unfortunately, decided to make the redial function activate with a single touch to the button.  Every headset I've ever used made the single touch be voice-dialing.  The problem here is that you will accidentally call the last person you spoke with on numerous occasions.  Even when I try to end the call, if the person ended the call before me, and I push the button to end, it will redial them.  I've done this several times already.  Samsung was not using their heads on this at all.  To activate voice-dialing, you must press the button and hold it until you hear a beep.INSTRUCTIONSThe manual is easy to read and clear.  It's more thorough than some I've read.SUMMARYThere were hardly any reviews for this headset when I purchased it and I only bought it because of how inexpensive it was.  After a couple of weeks of use, I bought one for my wife and now both my sister-in-laws have one too.  They have the same complaints about the redial button, but are happy with the headset regardless.  I would not recommend this headset at full price, but the after rebate price makes this good, not perfect headset, worthy of trying.","4.0","Tremendous value after rebate, but with caveats","1212883200","06 8, 2008"

So I picked this up on Amazon.I used it with a Sprint Sanyo phone and the performance was terrible. I lived with it since I knew I was going to upgrade soon. I upgraded my phone to a iphone with AT&T;, it was even worse. Turns out my buddy was using a Samsung phone. We think that this works great coupled with a Samsung phone but it seems to dislike other brands. In the end, it ended up getting washed in a pair of my pants and didn't work any more.

I want to save you the trouble that none of these other reviews did for myself.  Most of the reviews were great so I bought it.  I have to say the sound is pretty decent, very similar if not slightly worse than my wep200.  The wep410 looks very stylish, but it just doesn't FIT RIGHT IN THE EAR.  It feels like it is going to fall out and it doesn't sit at the angle where it is pointing from your ear to your cheek, which is what the wep200 does.  When it sits at the angle it is NOTICEABLY flaring outwards.  It looks like it is sticking out of your cheek at a 30-40 Degree angle, which looks extremely odd.  I tried all three different sized earbuds, but no luck with any of them.  I can get it to fit in my ear, but the fit of the earbuds is VERY poor.  I even got my father to try this headset to see if I had deformed ear canals, but they also didn't fit him right.  I really wish I could return this, but since I have opened it I can't.  Sadly, I had to give the headset to my father.  (He doesn't care how poor the fit is as long as he can use it for hands free calling in the car)Bottom line is that you SHOULD NOT buy this headset, but you should buy the Samsung Wep200.  That Headset is excellent for the price and very light in weight  That headset is also the one you want if you like ear buds like myself.

Even with a lot of noise going on (like when I'm on my motorcycle), the sound is incredibly sharp.Now, I see that they have a new version out, and if they'd like to send me one, I'd be more than happy to see what changes Aliph has made, but I'm very pleased with the one I have.","4.0","Jawbone is it!","1215129600","07 4, 2008"

Well i have to tell you the Jawbone is the exception to the rule. You all know about the noise reduction on this headset. So i won't go into that more than to say its no lie its as good as advertised. and the incoming sound is great as well. at first i did'nt like it. it sounded a little tinny but i found that that was their voice with all the unnecessary frequencies elimated. they are much easier to understand. It kinda sounds like the incoming sound you hear when people talk on aircraft radios.The real enjoyment for me with this headset is the design and materials. first the ear loop is metal with a rubber cover which is great cause you can bend it for a perfect fit. I guess i have weird ears cause most of the headsets ive tried just dont fit. But with the jawbone i can just bend away without taking a hair dryer to it to melt the plastic to bend it. And second most of these in ear headsets require a snug fit in the ear canal. But who among us really finds that comfortable? maybe its just me but it really burns after a while. With the jawbone as long as the ear bud is near the ear canal you can hear it just fine, and it still doesn't wiggle off your ear because of the ability to mold the ear loop to fit. so all in all i have to give it a 5, cause as bluetooth headsets go its about the best your gonna get","5.0","Pretty darn good.","1221696000","09 18, 2008"

Is comes with a junk plastic case, that is useless for storing the charger and other stuff.  If you pay this much money for something, they should provide a nice case for storing it and the charger, manual, and shorty cable.  the little box they provide does not hold together. So you will need a new case for it right away.  All these little bits and pieces are guaranteed to be scattered and lost.Also, my first charger failed.  I discovered this by plugging it into my computer using the USB connection.  Jabra gave me all sorts of headaches to get a new one.  It took several messages where they asked for a serial number.  Try to find that?  I couldn't.  Then after exchanging several email over a stupid charger they told me I had to remove the rubber earpiece to find the serial number.

"A2MNGG6MODVLTG","B000RUPEOA","Dan Durig","[0, 1]","I have tested many headsets and this one is one of my favorites with some slight modifications. The noise cancelation is great and solves my problems while making calls from the data center or the airport. The web demo's are 100% accurate (see their website), however direct wind noise is still a problem for this headset. Volume is controlled by in sections and cycles through in 5 presses.The good: Noise cancelation makes this worth the extra money. It can be charged from USB or power with the included adapter. It is compatible with just about all phones and works well with most devices though it does tend to force a connection with some phones when it should not (causes reboots from time to time on some PDAs).  This is difficult to notice unless you are really looking for it.The bad: As good as the noise cancelation is it does not resolve direct wind noise or a screaming kid in the car, some things can just not be overcome. No headset has solved this problem yet. The ear pieces are cheap and break from time to time when trying to bend or store them, but there are 6 of them. This does not transport very well because of the size and I worry about it in my pocket unprotected. I ripped the back button off while removing the charger once, but Aliph replaced it for free quickly while under warranty in the first year. Some phones (cheap low end phones) have echo problems with the noise cancelation.TIP: It is hard to hear sometimes in loud areas, but I have removed their earpiece and put a jabra ear gel on the speaker to resolve the volume issues to seal it in your ear. This addition completes this headset.Works great in loud ambient noise areas, with the ear gel for you too. Design is neat and functional, but not extremely durable. I would buy it again to replace it, but would love to see their next model.  Still in my top few favorites for headsets.","4.0","Great noise canceling some quirks","1204502400","03 3, 2008"

I used to own a jabra that had the bud that stuck in your ear and would hurt my ear from the direct sound coming into my ear. I have also had numerous wired headsets and my wife has the pink motorola h500 which has tons of background noise.The jawbone sounds just like if you were holding your phone to your ear.The jawbone comes with 4 different hoops that go behind your ear.  1 large and 1 regular for each ear.  and also comes with 4 various buds that go in your ear.  Don't get frustrated right off the back if it doesnt fit your right out of the box.  Everyone has a different shaped ear.  At first I was disapointed with the standard round bud because it kept falling out of my ear, but after changing the hoops and found a bud that fit in my ear the jawbone feels snug and doesnt fall out of my ear and i barely know its on my ear.The buttons arent that big of a deal, just learn where they are and its not a problem, or just use your answer button on your phone. You usually look to see who is calling anyway, dont you?The background noise reduction works very well, I had my dad tell me that I my voice sounded somewhat tinny (like tin can), but i turned the noise reduction off and he said it made a huge difference and would much rather have the voice sound a little off than have all the background noise.I read some reviews on amazon and they said it seemed plasticy and fragile.  Of course it is made of plastic and what bluetooth isnt?

"A23ZNGL704AW7O","B000RUPEOA","Jennifer Ray","[26, 28]","Quite simply, the Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset totally rocks!  Believe me, I've gone through quite a few Bluetooth headsets in the last couple of years, and so I have quite a few to compare this one to.First off, the design of it looks a bit off-putting.  It uses military-grade noise reduction technology and the look of the headset makes me believe that this particular headset may have been originally intended for such use.  It's not exactly the most attractive headset out there - definitely not the most feminine.But to be completely honest with you, after trying a number of `prettier' headsets that either break easily, lose their pairing with the phone frequently, or just plain don't work as well I am all for sacrificing form for function.All that said, while it may not be the most aesthetically pleasing Bluetooth headset, it is not the ugliest either.  It is interesting to note the design differences in the newer Jawbone model that Aliph just released, however.  They've presented a much more attractive version with a sleeker, less obtrusive style, seemingly proving that the manufacturer recognizes the customer's desire, frivolous though we may be, for a headset that is pleasing to the eye.Now for the important part:  how it works.  The Jawbone was simple to pair with my cell phone (HP iPaq 6945 Unlocked Cell Phone with Wi-fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, SD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)), as most Bluetooth headsets are.  More importantly, I've paired it once and it has maintained that pairing without issue ever since, unlike the previous headset I owned which lost its pairing at least once a week, usually while mid-conversation.  This is annoying, certainly, but for a user that won't use their cell phone while driving without a hands-free device, this is very unsettling.  If I wanted/needed to continue a call while on the road, I disconnected the call, pulled over to re-pair the two devices, and then started my call and my trip again.  This is a major issue for me, so I am extremely appreciative of Jawbone's reliability.Next feature:  Noise Reduction.  Aliph makes a big deal about their noise reduction technology, and having now used it with amazing results, I understand why.  They DESERVE to tout their success in this arena.  Yeah, it is that good.  Watching the videos they have on their website demonstrating the quality made me curious, but I admit to having my doubts that it could really eliminate background noise to the extent that they promised.I've purposely stress-tested it in some pretty noisy situations.  First of all, my own vehicle.  I have an older car, and it seems to pick up all of the outside noise there is, even with my windows up.  If it is raining, my callers could hear the rain on the windshield when using other headsets.  When a semi drove alongside my car, the noise of the big truck distracted my callers from our conversation.Aliph's Jawbone headset changed all that.  My friends and family no longer even suspect I'm in the car when I use it.  If they call me while I'm in a grocery store or department store, they hear neither the hubbub of the store nor the announcements over the building intercom.  Then I went to my favorite wing restaurant, which keeps the music pretty loud.  I stood directly under one of their speakers and asked my friend if she could hear it.  She thought she heard some people speaking faintly in the background.  She had no idea I was standing under a speaker with music blaring at me.As for the fit of the headset, it is very secure on my ear.  Like most others, it hooks over the ear, which makes it fit a bit oddly with sunglasses or eyeglasses, but it isn't uncomfortable.  When I get a new headset/earpiece, one of the first things I do is to put it on and shake my head around a bit to test how securely it fits my ear.  This one didn't budge.  For me, this is a very important factor.  If I can't move my head naturally as needed while driving, then the headset impedes my ability to drive and I won't have that.Some of you probably want to know about how it charges.  I use mine quite a bit for both personal and business, and it isn't rare for me to wear out the charge before the day is out.  I've only managed to drain my Jawbone twice, and it charges so quickly that I was able to use it again within an hour or so.  It comes with a cable that can charge through an electrical outlet or a USB port on a PC.  It does not have a car charger, but since I have a power inverter for my car, I can simply use it to charge it while driving should the need arise, so this isn't a deal breaker for me.All in all, I highly recommend the Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset.  When I finally break or lose this one, I will look at replacing it with another Aliph model before any other manufacturer.Most recent Headsets I've used:Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Headset - BlackJabra BT250v Bluetooth Headset with Vibrating Alert [Retail Packaged]Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth HeadsetMotorola H300 Bluetooth Headset","5.0","Reliable Bluetooth headset with fantastic noise reduction capabilities!","1211328000","05 21, 2008"
"A680RUE1FDO8B","B000RUPEOA","Jerry Saperstein","[6, 7]","Like so many others, I am on a perpeptual search for the perfect Bluetooth headset. I want it to slip over my ear quickly, to fit firmly into my ear canal, allow me to hear clearly while I am standing in the midst of a roaring crowd and reproduce my voice perfectly no matter how lousy my connection.Someone on  quest like this encounters a lot of disappointment.The Jabra 510 met some of these requirements, but not the critical ones. Hearing the other party often required pressing it into my ear and I often received complaints that I was difficult to hear.Many reviews on the Jawbone have been glowing . . . and some have been downright derogatory. I figured that I might as well try it.The design is visually appealing, but the earband is a piece of bad design. Apparently made of aluminum or some metal alloy, it is relatively inflexible and difficult to place over the ear. One point against. There have also been reports that these earloops are easy to break.There are only two buttons, both of which are hidden. One is relatively easy to find, the other requires a bit of hunting. This second button is also the volume control. Press it a bit too long and you've just turned off Bluetooth and lost your call.The visual indicators for status are sparse, so often you are left guessing as to precisely what status your Jawbone is in. I found that restablishing my Bluetooth connection, which I had accidentally severed, was way more difficult than it had to be.Initial pairing was flawlessly simple, but if you lose your connection while driving on an expressway, for example, trying to reconnect turns you into an accident waiting to happen.Received audio quality is pretty good. Using the standard ear bud, the fit was good, but not perfect. The volume control proved to be hit-or-miss. Sometimes pressing it as the directions specified increased the volume. Sometimes it broke my Bluetooth connection.I tested the voice transmission capability by turning up the television and radio at the same time and calling my own voicemail. I must tell you, the noise cancelling technology works very well. Voice quality is acceptable: we're talking cell phone audio here, not concert hall acoustics.The battery seems to last the specified times, but the proprietary charger connections are not only a bad idea, but stupid as well. While one end of the cable can be plugged into a standard USB slot, the end that attaches to the Jawbone is proprietary. This is just plain dumb. It should be a mini-USB. Instead you have to remember to pack yet one more cable.Is the Jawbone worth the premium price? Kind of doubtful. With other headsets, I've never been unable to complete a phone call, although sometimes I have had a hard time hearing and being understood. The Jawbone does make your voice more intelligible with its noise cancelling abilities. So I guess the determination would be how often you would need to depend on that noise cancelling technology. I am also wary of Aliph's customer support. Many Amazon reviews have remarked on poor build quality, breakage and very poor customer support by the manufacturer.Jerry","4.0","Good noise cancellation; ergonomics only fair","1208390400","04 17, 2008"

Volume level is adequate even when on noisy roads and people on the other end have actually remarked positively about the level of quality.  I only wish the Jawbone engineers had stopped tinkering when they perfected the audio quality and not designed a fit system so complicated and brittle that it impairs my ability to actually use the device.The ear loop has about the consistency (and strength) of a paper clip.  The result is something so flimsy that Jawbone Inc. considers earloops to be a consumable.  After receiving the Jawbone as a gift this holiday season I was unable to use it as all of the included earloops snapped off within the first day of use.  Needless to say I didn't start using the product until about February after waiting for customer service to send me replacements.  Any future earloops, they tell me, will have to be purchased for $2.50 each!The sound is great but like others on here the fit leaves something to be desired.  This after trying the infinite combinations of earloops and earbuds the unit comes with.  Turning my head quickly often requires a readjustment even with the tightest fitting earloop.  I realize that all ears are different but I've had cheap headsets that fit great because the engineers did not try to over-engineer the fit process.I am sure there are other great sounding bluetooth devices in this price range that are better constructed and will provide less aggravation.

I'm happy to report that I experienced neither of these problems.  The headset fits perfectly around my ear, it doesn't slip even when I'm moving, and I'm barely aware that it's there.  Also, the charger fits snugly into the socket and I haven't had any trouble with loose connections.Sound quality seems to be great, the people I talked to say they can hear me fine even in loud environments.  As mentioned in other reviews, this headset does not cancel wind noise, probably because wind noise is highly variable.  So, don't expect to use this on a gusty day or while riding in a convertible.My BIGGEST COMPLAINT with this product is the clunky charger.  Why does every electronics company insist on introducing their own charger socket standard when there is a perfectly fine standard (Mini USB) already out there?  Motorola phones, BlackBerries, most PDAs and many other headsets all use this standard charging socket.  This means I don't need to lug around an extra charger, as I can charge my phone and headset off the same charger.  Unfortunately, the Jawbone charger is completely nonstandard... I can't even get an iGo power tip for it.  Finally, the charger itself is poorly designed.  It's another huge brick that takes up two power sockets.  The rubber cover that covers the socket on the headset when you're not charging removes completely and I'm sure I will lose it within a month.  You'd think that a company that could design such a cool headset would put a little more thought into the charger.However, you buy a headset to talk clearly and on that point this one delivers.","3.0","Great Sound Quality, But...","1184284800","07 13, 2007"

"A1MQ57NNYTAUCN","B000RUPEOA","Robert Sommer","[1, 1]","If you have the original Jawbone I wouldn't recommend upgrading to this newer model. I purchased the JB2 because I liked the JB1 so much.The JB2 syncs right out of the box provided that you remember to hold the power button on for 7 seconds or so from the off position to sync it for the first time. After that its pretty self explanatory.The original JB1 had a nice sound to it. The new JB2 sounds like cheap car speakers that are turned up too loud. It distorts sound easily at higher volumes. It is very lightweight and relatively comfortable. Let's face it - human ears come in different shapes and sizes. Hopefully yours will be the same shape and size as one of the three ear buds provided with the new JB. They eliminated the old tear drop shape earbud from the new model which is disappointing since I found that one to be the most comfortable fit. You will find that none of your old JB1 accessories will work with the JB2. This includes the earbuds and loops.I would have liked to see them improve on what they started with rather than make a lighter one that sounds worse. If I knew now what I knew then I would not make the leap for the new one just yet. I feel like whatever improvments were made, were quickly lost in sound quality. For $60 you can still get a 1st generation that sounds better.The JB2 has lots of room for improvement. If the sound quality were brought up to par with the JB1, and it included the teardrop earbud I'd give it 5 stars. In summary its about prioritization. If sound quality is your top priority, get the JB1 and save some cash. If comfort is more important to you than great sound, you may really like the JB2.  Despite the harsh criticism, I like the unit a lot. After getting used to the earbud I don't even realize I'm wearing it. After a couple hours though it starts to hurt.","3.0","JB2 is a Mixed Bag","1232323200","01 19, 2009"

It fits me pretty well, doesn't fall out, has good audio for hearing, and I have consistently gotten good audio reports from the people I talk to.A few nits.  The charger hookup unit is just plain wierd, and is counterintuitive to hook up.  Why do engineers feel compelled to make thousands of different charging standards for similar devices?  Also, while talking, you have to be careful if you adjust the unit on your ear--it is easy to accidentally hang up on someone.Overall, this is the first hands-free device that I have actually been able to tolerate and use.

"A1F9Z42CFF9IAY","B000RUPEOA","T. Tom","[17, 25]","The Jawbone bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for. Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made. It looks metal but really is cheap bendy plastic material.Further, once you set it up, you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this.While the Jawbone's noise cancellation does seem good that's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled, soft and digital-like. Further, the Jawbone is too big and bulky to comfortably put it into a pocket to take with you.But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible. They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But, my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it, they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website. If I bought from some other retailer, it has ZERO warranty! I'm not sure whether or not this is even legal since I'm not a lawyer, but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they don't even stand behind their own products.I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph.","1.0","Very poor quality and customer service from Jawbone","1186444800","08 7, 2007"

"A35SM57R1CRSHA","B000RZCI80","Dean Buzzell","[0, 1]","I'd seen the Jawbone commercials - you know, the guy with all the loud yard equipment in the background, and wondered if the noise reduction you REALLY got was as dramatic as the commercial would  have you believe.NOISE REDUCTION:Well, not quite, but it DOES reduce background noise for the person on the other end of the connection, NOT you. I tried switching from noise reduction enabled to disabled while standing within earshot of a busy expressway). My calls could all hear the background noise when noise reduction was enabled (the default state), but disabling it caused the noise they heard to be so great they couldn't understand me. I can't say that noise reduction was 100%, but it was pretty darned good.FIT:I was a little uncomfortable with the fit at first - it seemed too loose to me. The unit comes with several ear loops and ear buds, and I tried them all before settling on the loop and bud that came installed out of the box. As I've grown accustomed to the unit, though, the 'looseness' no longer bothers me, and I find I can wear it the entire day without discomfort. In noisy environments I find I have to press the earbud deeper into my ear to drown out ambient noise. This hasn't been a huge inconvenience, because I don't spend that much time in high-noise environments, but I could see it being a major annoyance if I did.APPEARANCE:I've seen plenty of grey and black Jawbones (even one that was painted with shimmery pink nail polish), but have never seen another red one like mine. I get a lot of positive comments on both color and appearance.I really like the appearance of the unit. It's distinctive; clean lines, no visible buttons. It just LOOKS easy to use.BLUETOOTH:I've used several Bluetooth headsets, with varying degrees of ease in pairing the unit to my phone. This one was one of the easiest and quickest setups I've done. My phone is a Blackjack II, using Windows Mobile 6.PRICE:I've wanted a Jawbone for some time now, but wasn't willing to purchase one until the price fell under $80. Of course, that was only because Jawbone II was recently released. I don't know that I'd invest in a full-priced Jawbone or Jawbone II, but it was definately worth what I paid for mine.I highly recommend this product.","4.0","Works great!

I am not all that impressed for the price of it.Cons: I don't care of the ear piece shoved into my ear. It is very invasive to have a actual ear bud! It has to fit well for the noise reduction to work. I still have people complain they can't hear me occasially (rarely though) and I have to shove the thing in my ear and make sure it's sitting straight for optimal performance. It's also kind of bulky.Also, the ON & OFF button to get it connected is hard to use. You have to push it quite hard (shoving the ear bud into your ear) for the headset to turn on and you must remember to turn it off prior to using your phone w/o the headset. Unlike my previous motorolla where I opened the headpiece and it worked..this is much more of a hassel.Pros: Overall audio works quite well. I do not have a problem driving in the car now nor do I feel like I need to cup the ear piece as I occasionally did with my Motorolla (prior to losing it).If I had to buy it again...I don't know if I would invest so much in this headset.

"A2PL4KZQJ0VFOB","B000RZFNN2","D. Dell Dell","[7, 7]","I have tried several headsets to find one I like. I finally tried the Jawbone and it is a keeper.The Jawbone has excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. The person on the other end thought I was on a landline phone. On my end the caller comes in loud and clear. I even turned on a vacuum cleaner and stood next to it and the other person did not hear it at all. You can adjust the volume, but I let the headset do that. Somehow it senses the noise level around you and adjusts the volume accordingly for both you and the person you are calling.This headset is larger than it appears in pictures. It is also a little heavier then some others I have tried. The only downside is that it is very difficult to put on. I suppose I will figure it out with some practice. It is not quite as comfortable as some others I have tried, but I am getting use to it. After having it on for a while I did not even notice it was on my ear.It comes with 4 ear hooks, which is 2 for left and 2 for right ear. That sounds odd, but the hooks are slightly bent to fit either right or left ear. The reason is because it is spring loaded to gently force the speaking sensor next to your face. The hooks are 2 different sizes and the wire can be bent to better fit your ear. After doing some adjustments the headset fits snuggly and does not flop around. It also comes with 4 different shaped ear buds. The charger is unusual. The cable that plugs into the wall charger is USB, so you can use the same cable to charge the Jawbone on your PC.As with most headsets you have to get use to putting it on and adjusting it where it fits comfortably and correctly to get the best sound. The minor negatives do not mean much compared to features and sound quality. That is why I give it 5 stars.Update: I have read several reviews complaining that they just could not get the Jawbone to fit or the ear bud to stay in their ear. Here is what I did. I first gently bent the ear loop to more of a closed position to fit tighter around my ear. Then, as you know, the loop is already bent to force the ear bud more into your ear and the speaker closer to your face. I took that shape and bent it a little farther. Now, the ear bud fits farther into my ear and the headset feels more comfortable and does not flop around. Obviously if you bend it too far it will break. So, be careful. This adjustment worked for me. I also took the advice of another reviewer about how to put the headset on. This is, basically, what he said. Put your thumb over the ear bud. Hold the headset horizontally and flat against your head then start sliding the end of the loop over the top of your ear. Then as you slide it on, rotate it at the same time to the correct position. It really works and now I can get it on with one hand in 2 seconds.Another update: Even though the noise cancellation really works, it also breaks up your voice and the callers voice. I suggest you only use the noise cancellation when you need it. Since the noise cancellation is set to be on by default when you turn the headset on, you have to turn it off yourself.UPDATE: It has only been a couple of months since I wrote the above review. The plastic end of the Jawbone that the charger plugs into just broke and is stuck in the charger. I noticed the black plastic end piece was held on by two very tiny plastic hooks and one of them broke. If this is any example of build quality, then I can now only give this headset 2 stars overall.","5.0","Better quality that most other headsets - UDATE at end of review","1197590400","12 14, 2007"
"APP8XWYYV4PAA","B000RZFNN2","Debra A Chong ECommerceMaven","[1, 1]","This is the fifth Bluetooth headset I have purchased. Previous Motorola and Jabra headsets were harder to use, less durable (fell apart) and did not fit my small ears very well. The sound quality is great and when I first got this, I took it on a trip and used it to make conference calls from my hotel room, answer calls on the street and in the car. It is the best Bluetooth headset that I have purchased, as it was easy to pair, sound quality is great and the battery life holds up as promised.1. If you can, it is better to try on or look at a headset in real life before buying it on Amazon. All of these headsets fit differently. Or else you return it if it does not work well for you. (I did not buy this from Amazon for myself due to fit but I bought it as a present for my brother from Amazon).2. Less fancy buttons, the better it is as you can learn to use it easily and there are less moving parts to break.3. None of the Bluetooth headsets are outstanding as they are very small, so do not assume that it is supposed to do everything and anything.4. If a Bluetooth headset does not work well for you and you can not return it at a later time, pass it on to a friend who can use it.I purchased the Jawbone at full retail at an AT&T; store (and they will replace it if it falls apart and you still have the receipt)as I could not find a headset with the right fit without trying it on (they have sample headsets that you can try) and I was leaving on a business trip shortly. However, as I noted, I bought this at Amazon for my brother and he LOVES it (had a Motorola and Jabra before). He wears it every day when he walks to work and in the car when he is driving.I don't use my headset except when I travel now as I have a car with Bluetooth and my phone automatically pairs to the car audio. However, I am sure when I travel, it will be used extensively (I carry it every day in my computer backpack and it is holding up well --- ).","5.0","Best Bluetooth Headset, Durable and Easy to Use","1203206400","02 17, 2008"
"A10U3Z35FCPXF2","B000RZFNN2","Dennis bozhed","[12, 12]","I just purchased the Jawbone this week. I did quite a bit of research before buying. I tend to be pretty skeptical of Bluetooth headsets. I currently own about 6 of them. Two different models of Plantronics, 2 models of Jabra, and 2 models of Motorola. This particular headset was of interest to me because I have a loud car (corvette) and none of my other headsets do an adequate job of cutting out the road and engine noise.I have only had the headset for a day however, I am impressed. I tried the Jawbone today in the Corvette and it works great. My wife didn't hear anything but me while I was driving, which is pretty amazing considering how loud the car is. I currently have the Blackberry 8830 and it works great with this headset. The voice dialing pops right up on queue, unlike some of the other headsets I have.So far the only negative is the fit which has been mentioned before. I prefer the in ear variation on the set versus over the ear. (The Jawbone can be used without the ear hook) The fit is not exactly tight but it does seem to work without falling out. I think it will just take some getting used to and playing with the other interchangeable ear adapters.From a sound level standpoint the unit is great. It is down right loud and I can hear the person on the other end with no problem even with my stereo partly on.Overall, I am impressed and happy with my purchase.Update 6/9/07Fit - After playing around with the different ear ear pieces and hooks, I finally have found a combination that works. I have to use a ear hook, which isn't my favorite but after you get used to it, it isn't too bad. Also, it fits much more securely with the hook and is more comfortable.Additionally I have spoken with a number of others via the headset and towards the end of the conversation I ask them how I sound and they all have said great.Update 6/14/07Well this one is a keeper. Now that it has been a few days I have gotten used to using the headset with the ear hook and it works great. Takes some getting used to and practice to put in on one handed but once you do, it's pretty easy. Call quality continues to be excellent. If I could rate it higher than a 5 I would. By far the best headset I have used.Update 11/2/07Still using the Jawbone.  Very happy with it.  Currently using it with a LG 8350 and it works great.","5.0","As far as I am concerned....best headset currently out!!","1193443200","10 27, 2007"

Glue it together if you really like it.Motorola L6- stock verizon unit- overpriced.Pros:I walk across a campus and between buildings, exposed to the elements for a few minutes of the day.  None of these headsets can handle minor wind noise, not even a slight breeze.  The Jawbone is only slightly better with wind but it is hardly worth noting.The Jawbone noise reduction works in many situations that all others do not.I have verified the in-car with stereo playing test- windows down (but don't get the device in the wind).  The server room- I turned off the noise reduction, the other party did not even know I was in the server room until I turned off the noise cancellation.At my local noisy echoing jazzy starbucks- the other headsets were useless and I would have to go outside.  The jawbone allows me to speak in a normal voice despite being in a loud environment.Looks very cool- always getting complements.Others I have convinced to purchase the jawbone like the selection of clips and earpieces, the noise reduction really works.Cons:Ear clip material- I think it's metal- it will break after being bent a few times (my first one lasted four months), it's not like wire in that it does not feel like it's supposed to be bent to fit to your ear.Ear plug does not fit well enough, should be made of that sticky rubber stuff like jabra and plantronics.  I'm going to try one of the jabra earpieces as others have suggested.Apparently wind noise is very difficult to cancel- it makes me want to put a foam or fabric wind screen on it- that's the only problem I have with the sound.I wear it often, it holds itself under tension on my ear.  When I take it off it still feels like it's there for a while.  I often forget I have it on too, and end up in family photos wearing it.It occasionally goes through a connection losing spat- it must be powered off for a few minutes when it does this.  It happens every few weeks and is SUPER ANNOYING. I have read other reviews that voice this issue.  The benefits outweigh the annoyance for me.  It would be a five were it not for the disconnect issue.The ringing music sound, connection and power off sounds are all pure tones.  They sound primative, like atari 2600.  Slightly grating, considering how loud they can be relative to the environment.  I'm guessing all the development costs went into noise cancellation and styling... nothing was spent on the audible status/ring sounds- or someone likes atari 2600.This is the official brittany spears headset.

"A3BMK3DZDH0N6Q","B000RZFNN2","TechMSS","[1, 1]","I purchased this headset with very high hopes. Indeed, the noise cancellation feature works very well. I would often call my family and friends while standing next to a busy street corner, and they would be none the wiser. The sound quality is excellent.However, there are major quality control problems. The charging port on the bottom of the headset gets stuck in the charging adapter, and after several weeks or months of use, it will completely come off. This renders the device inoperable, because you are no longer able to successfully charge it.After this happened to my first headset, I contacted the company and they quickly replaced it. However, the replacement developed the exact same problem in a manner of weeks. I will contact the company again, and I am sure that they will replace it again, but I am not confident that the next replacement will be free of the same defect.As cool as the noise cancellation feature is, and as good as the outgoing sound is, I cannot in good conscience recommend this headset until they sort out the quality control problems. Still, I am giving it 4 stars, because when it works it works very well. Caveat emptor.","4.0","Fantastic sound, but shoddy construction","1205193600","03 11, 2008"

The DLO Leather Holster Case is strong and fits close to the hip. The clip is VERY tight, and difficult to slide onto even the thinnest of belts, but I believe this to be an asset; there is absolutely no way this case will ever slip off your belt. The real test for this case will be how well it stands up to daily wear. As long as the clip does not break and separate from the holster, I will remain very pleased. I have not noticed a lack of protection from the open corners of the case. The phone removes easily when needed but is snug within the case. Though I have only used the case for about two weeks now, I am very pleased with it and would recommend it without hesitation.UPDATE, August 16, 2009- As noted above, my concern with this case was that the belt clip might become loose with wear, and that has been the case. I would downgrade my rating on this item to three stars.","3.0","So far, so good...","1246579200","07 3, 2009"

"A1AYBKV6DO2389","B000S0B9ZC","Mr. Smarty","[0, 0]","This is the only case I have for my phone but I did look at and try out several others in the store before buying.  The dealer at the AT&T store cautioned me that it was a tight fit and that he didn't like it for that reason.  I have since found that it is really a perfect fit, and not tight at all, if you insert the phone in the correct orientation - which is to say with the screen facing the back.  Secure but not tight with no risk of falling out.  I read the complaints about the cutaways.  I actually count the cutaways at the corners as an advantage because they allow you to access the controls and have headphones plugged in while in the case, which other cases without the cutaways do not.  I suppose if you have the misfortune of dropping the phone in the case and a corner hits then it might damage the corners but I wanted that added functionality, so just don't drop your phone.  I think this is the most attractive of all the cases and I am proud to wear it on my belt at work or with dress clothes.  The velcro latching mechanism is superb and I don't see this ever wearing out like some cheaper velcro does.  also I paid $30 dollars for this at the AT&T store so the amazon.com price is a bargain.

It tears away from the leather backing and then the phone can just drop off your waist. Because of the really good padding on this case you may not even know that it dropped and some lucky person walking behind you will get a free Iphone.I am on my Second DLO case so this is not some unlucky fluke, there is a defect in the way the Belt clip is bonded to the leather case and believe me when it starts to rip away its only a matter of days before the phone and leather case fall away from the clip.","3.0","Great Case but the Belt Clip lasts 6 months then goes bad.","1246579200","07 3, 2009"

"A1F9Z42CFF9IAY","B000S0B9ZC","T. Tom","[27, 37]","The iPhone really needs a horizontal case like this one. It's a bit long and wearing it on your hip vertically makes it uncomfortable and unwieldy when you sit down. Whereas a vertical case eliminated this problem. In terms of looks, I feel horizontal and vertical both look equally as cool but a horizontal case is a lot more convenient, at least to me.This DLO case is nicely made and seems durable but unfortunetly, there is a flaw in the design: the exposed open parts can make your iPhone very vunerable to scratches. I noticed a fairly deep scratch on the back of my iPhone right where the middle opening on this case is. It could have happened from a zipper, metal button or most probably from a rivet on my jeans coming in contact with the back of the iPhone through the slot. I am switching to another case that covers more of the iPhone.Just a side note about rubber iPhone cases: I don't like the feel of the rubber cases at all-they feel weird in the hand. And the rubber cases tend to stretch out over time and this lets in dust and grit which can scratch the iPhone. Also Apple recommends you not charge the iPhone will in a rubber case because the heat will not be able to dissipate. This means you have to keep taking it out of the rubber case and putting it back in every time you charge. You can see that these types of cases are less than ideal.","2.0","Nicely made but exposes iPhone to damage","1184284800","07 13, 2007"

Plenty just don't work right. But I was very happy to find when I bought my Motorola Droid that there was a real Motorola car charger available for cheap on Amazon, so I was sold. This, my Droid, and theCar Dockmake a very happy trio for navigation in my car.However, there are a few minor concerns I'd like to point out: First, the blue LED. Not only does the end of the charger seem to only take up space and shamelessly promote Motorola, the blue LED creates a bit of a distraction, at least where my cigarette lighter is in my vehicle. I'm thinking of taking it apart and removing the LED, but I don't travel at night too much with it so I might let it slide. Second, I've noticed that sometimes it doesn't actually charge the phone, just keep it powered - but to be fair, this is probably either my Droid or the car, not the fault of the charger itself.I haven't had a chance to try charging any other MicroUSB devices with my charger, but I can only assume it works swimmingly.

See my review on the Samsung OEM charger for more details.The charger quickly powers your phone and looks good while doing it.  Motorola gave it a sleek design that lights up blue when the charger is ready.  The cord is long enough for mid size or smaller vehicles to keep it plugged in while using the Navigation app on your phone.  If you have a Samsung Galaxy S2 or S3 and need a back up or replacement car charger, I highly recommend this purchase.","5.0","Great Find!","1375574400","08 4, 2013"

It was just enough power to maintain how much battery was in there when I started the trip. With the carhome app the screen doesn't turn off unless you do it yourself. So I turned the screen off and when I got to my destination the battery went from 60 to 85% full in about an hour or so.

Just have a full charge, and I was good to go.But, with the droidx, once you start using the smart phone features, like the GPS (which I use when I leave my regular GPS at home), the battery goes down faster than just used as a phone.And, with the price ($4.71, though it's now $3.15), I figured why not?

I didn't think there was a big difference til the battery in my Samsung Galaxy S2 smart phone stopped holding a charge after only 10 months. I would fully charge the phone overnight and 2-3 hours after unplugging it the phone would die. A tech at my local Sprint store looked at the phone and said the battery showed signs of slight swelling which means it wasn't being charged properly. I knew it had to be my cheap knock-off car charger so I looked for a good one on Amazon and bought this one. I love the Motorola car charger. It doesn't overheat my phone and doesn't fry my phone battery.  The cool blue light on the charger is subtle but very sharp looking. The metal prongs on my old crappy knock-off charger were super tight and barely fit in the charging port. The Motorola prongs are much smoother, very easy to plug in and easy to remove.The old cheap charger I was using would make my phone very very warm (almost hot) when I had it plugged in for over an hour but on several 1-2 hour trips my phone barely even gets warm with the Motorola charger.  The Motorola charges my phone pretty fast without over heating it even when I stream online radio through my car's Bluetooth and use GPS on the phone at the same time. Don't try to save $3-$4 by buying a car charger that could fry your phone's battery or even worse fry your whole phone.

"A2I18AO597DSDI","B000S5Q9CA","David Pearlman sound fanatic","[1656, 1693]","There are so many sketchy sellers selling phone chargers out there, that it can be a bit scary. The problem is that if the charger is poorly made, the output of the charger can be out of spec and can, in some cases, fry the phone you connect to it.For that reason, when it comes to phone chargers, you should stick to name brands. (They are all made in China, but the name brand ones are usually subject to stricter QA).When I found this charger on Amazon, SOLD BY AMAZON, I jumped on it. It's a MICRO USB car charger, made for Motorola and sold under the Motorola name, in retail packaging. The rated output is 4.75-5.25V and 950mA.This charger should work fine with most any phone that uses the MICRO USB connector. The key number to pay attention to is the second one, the rated amperage. This is the MAXIMUM amount of current that the phone can request from the charger. A typical USB port on a PC provides as little as 100mA, and few provide more than 500mA. So this charger should charge your phone faster than when it's connected to a PC. A few phones out now can use up to 1000mA. But that just means they CAN use that amount. If 950mA is provided, they'll still charge, just a bit more slowly.Note that the amperage (second number) merely tells you how much the charger CAN supply, if requested. The phone itself is responsible for asking for the current. That is to say, if this charger can provide 950mA, but your phone can only use 300mA--no problem. Your phone asks for 300mA and the charger provides all of what is requested. If, on the other hand, your phone can use 1000mA, this charger will provide all it can, which is 950mA--a wee bit less than the max asked for. That's also not a problem; it just means your phone will charge a little bit (not much in this case) more slowly. The rated voltage for this charger is presented in a range of 4.75-5.25V. The ideal voltage for a USB charger of any type if 5V. And most chargers for home use are rated right at 5V. But car chargers work in a noisier environment and thus you have the range. This is where a cheapo charger can really do damage, as some of them are poorly regulated and can provide voltages that are WAY out of spec. Again, when you can get a name brand charger from a seller you can trust (Amazon) for such a reasonable price, it's very foolish to consider the cheapo no-names.This is an excellent quality name brand travel micro USB charger at a price that beats the no-name junk from third party sellers. What's not to like?BE SURE TO ORDER IT FROM AMAZON AND NOT ONE OF THE THIRD PARTY SELLERS, as some of those have been known to make mistakes with respect to what they ship relative to the listing. I can confirm that Amazon is shipping the P513 /89143N charger, as pictured.","4.0","Genuine Motorola charger in retail packaging. 4.75-5.25V 950mA output, works w/ most micro-USB phones like Incredible, etc.","1276214400","06 11, 2010"

"A2V7EO331SFUF6","B000S5Q9CA","D.B. Spalding","[2, 2]","I bought this direct from Amazon (Prime shipping, 2-day was free), and received the charger in OEM packaging (not retail packaging) the next day. (I love Prime!) The inner bag identifies it as a SPN5400A, part #11224-0817337; both numbers are on the charger, though the second is 11224-CC-0817337, and also has CHR-0291 imprinted on it. (Check the image gallery.) The outer bag carried the part #PVN1616, and a barcoded number, 760492-013772, I don't know what those are, stocking codes?As demonstrated in another buyer's video review, the MicroUSB plug has a holographic QA sticker (doesn't have Motorola logo, just a check mark graphic). The obverse of the plug has the Motorola M clearly and cleanly molded into it. The plug is molded as one, solid piece. The charger portion is okay, nothing fancy or super-solid, but it holds together. Part numbers are clearly printed on it. It also has a handy little clip on the cord (visible in the first product image) that lets you keep the cord together, either in storage or in use.Pardon the pun, but the proof is in the plug-in. As measured on my HTC Amaze 4G, this charger provides up to 800mA of charging current while plugged into an AC adapter, compared with 400mA from a similar Duracell car charger. In my car, the charger provides slightly less, but still sufficient to charge the phone while Waze is working (which uses the display, GPS receiver, and 4G network for maps). This is what I've been looking for, as other lesser chargers actually let the phone's battery drain down due to insufficient charging current. A charger that provides ~800mA - 900mA means the difference of an hour or so LESS to completely charge up, compared with a ~300mA - 400mA charger, if the phone is not in use.Because so many buyers of this and other chargers complain of counterfeit or substituted products for what are listed as OEM replacements, I urge you to buy only direct from Amazon. Ensure the transaction is covered by Amazon's usual product return guarantee, so that if you do get a substitution or fake, you can return it for a full refund, without paying for shipping. Until Amazon cracks down on sellers' misleading listings, you are really walking into the lion's den slathered with A-1 sauce when you take a chance on a third party seller, just to save a few dollars.","5.0","Pretty sure it's geniune, and it does charge faster -- read further to find out why","1333843200","04 8, 2012"

"APJB4OFJWPW3V","B000S5Q9CA","D. Deep","[0, 1]","My wife and I recently signed a new 2-year contract with Verizon and got new phones, which as usual means we need all new chargers for our cars. Rather than spend the $30 Verizon wants for their branded chargers, I ordered this charger for under $6. It appears to be of pretty high quality and charges my Motorola Barrage and my wife's Motorola Droid with no problems. There are only two negatives. The body of the unit is fairly long and bulky, sticking much farther out of the dash than the Verizon charger. Also, the futuristic-looking blue illuminated Motorola logo is huge, and at night it is so bright it can be a little distracting. I have found that if I turn the charger 90 degrees to either side, I can no longer see the huge gleaming logo.UPDATE: I just ordered another of these chargers which are of impressive quality for the money. The first one lasted nearly three years and just recently stopped charging my phones. In addition to the phones mentioned above, it has also worked well with our Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX and our Blackberry Bold. Happily for me, my new car allows me to put the charger inside a closed armrest storage area so I am no longer distracted by the gleaming blue M.","4.0","Good quality, low-cost alternative to Verizon charger","1282089600","08 18, 2010"

If I leave it plugged into the lighter, it will keep shining after I unplug my phone.  It's not super bright, and it didn't run down my car battery (even when my car sat for several days), but I do worry that some punk walking by will spot the blue light and, not knowing what it is, break into my car just to steal a charger.

"A3MPOPREPBPUR9","B000S5Q9CA","Good Times","[1, 2]","This is an original Motorola charger. It will fit any phone with a Micro USB charging port. (HTC Evo, Droid Incredible, Droid X, etc.)This charger is a high output, rapid charger. It will deliver up to 950mA of power. Most of the newer smart phones can draw 1A of power, so this charger will work perfectly for them. It will show on your phone as an AC power charge. This will charge your phone quickly and easily, even with multiple apps running, including GPS navigation and 4G.If your phone charges at less than 1A, that is still fine. It will NOT overcharge your phone. The charger can deliver UP TO 950mA, which means it will only deliver what is asked of it. If your phone only pulls 500mA, then it will only deliver 500mA.The construction quality is great. It seems solid and well built. I fully expect this to last a long time. It is a very attractive design, with stylish blue lighting. I don't know the exact length, but the cord is longer than most, and supple. It will easily and comfortably reach anywhere on or around the front seat.My girlfriend and I both have this charger, and we've both used them extensively. I can personally attest to its ability to fully charge while using GPS navigation, 4G, and running multiple apps during an extended 7 hour drive across the state. Using both her Incredible, and my Evo.This is a great price for such a quality cable. You should not be paying 20.00 dollars or more from the major phone carriers. Buy this, and you will be more than satisfied in every way. This is a much bette cable than anything the carriers sell.I am completely thrilled with this cable, and will not hesitate to recommend them to anyone, and purchase them as needed for gifts for others.Hope that helps...","5.0","Fast, full charge...

Even with the standard factory car charger (which is 500 ma), the battery still drains while the phone is being used as a GPS.After doing some research I came across this charger (which supplies 950ma) and from the buzz online it seemed like it would do the trick for me.  Well, it's an improvement over the standard 500ma charger, though not perfect.I find that on full brightness - which is typical of what you'll need for daytime car GPS usage - the battery still drains even when using this charger.  Bummer.  To be fair, the drain is much lower than the standard 500ma charger, and drastically less than using no charger at all, but the battery still slowly drops nonetheless.  If you drop the screen brightness, or turn the screen off for extended highway drives, then the battery drop all but ceases.So that is only a minor drawback.  A bigger drawback for me is that on several occasions my phone has overheated and frozen while using this charger with my phone's GPS fuction.  This required me unplugging the charger and rebooting my phone to remedy.  This is a HUGE pain when you are behind the wheel and driving somewhere you are unfamiliar with.  Keep in mind the standard 500ma charger would have no such overheating problems.  Apparently the engineers at Samsung specified the 500ma current in order to maintain full functionality of the phone under all conditions - even car GPS usage.  Anything over that is not within spec and could cause the phone to overheat under certain circumstances.That said, I am still fairly happy with the charger.  So long as I am not doing anything intensive with the phone in the car, it charges my phone very rapidly with no problems what so ever.

This charger is significantly faster, at least twice as powerful. This was an expected result as I have always had excellent experiences using Motorola's chargers.I took one star off because the LED is just way too bright out of the box for driving at night. Fortunately, they allowed the M circular window to be easily removed by popping out the bottom ring (look for a screwdriver indent). After removing the window, the LED is easily accessed, so I applied some white-out to the LED, which successfully lowered the light output to a tolerable level.The cord and connector seem to be high quality. The cord comes with a small hook to keep unwanted extra cord out of the way - a nice added touch.Very pleased with this charger so far overall.

It's basically sticking an advertisement for Motorola into your car, who wants that?Second, the price you pay, you can easily afford a dual-usb socket, which while meaning you'd have to provide your own USB cables, means you can charge two items at once, and it's not in your way as those sockets are relatively tiny.Third, the item emits a blue light, that illuminates the center plastic piece.

The plastic window makes the Motorola M glow a subdued blue, but it's not too bright as to be distracting so I don't mind it.Another thing to note, the coiled cord is softer than the Verizon cord but seems to retain it's shape.  This is a plus in my opinion since holding the phone or moving it around with the softer cord puts less stress on the USB jack in the phone.I bought mine directly from Amazon and I actually just ordered a second one, I don't see how you can go wrong with it (as long as you get a real one just like mine).","5.0","Better than Verizon charger","1304985600","05 10, 2011"

I've got 2 and they look really nice, are built well and work great. They definitely put my Verizon, AT&T; and Sprint branded chargers to shame, which have a difficult time charging with the screen on and GPS running. With the P518, I can have the phone blazing with everything imaginable running and it still charges. At a 1 amp charge capacity, it's fast too. Not like charge your phone from dead to full in 10 minutes fast, but faster than all the others I've tried.The only downside (if you can even call it a downside) is the blue light is a bit bright at night. Not like staring into the sun bright, but still somewhat bright. I actually love how it looks, so it's of no hindrance to me. Also, it sticks out a bit further than most chargers, so if your lighter receptacle is in a tight place, you may want to consider this.

OEM isn't sufficient anymore and most of the non brand name stuff is junk. Be sure to buy by Motorola (or whatever your brand is - but Motorola will work for most) and these are now half a ten spot on Amazon and lots more in the store.My one complaint, and reason for dinging a star, is that the cord is way too short for use in most vehicles. It's fine for a non smart phone sitting in the console or a cup holder - but it's far too short for smart phone use with the phone positioned on or near the dashboard.

"A10PEXB6XAQ5XF","B000S5Q9CA","Michael Gallagher","[1, 1]","ORIGINAL REVIEW:What can I say about this one - it does the job , delivers a steady and consistent amount of power to recharge my Motorola RAZR phone, and appears to be better-constructed and more durable than the non-OEM chargers for sale here on Amazon and elsewhere.  I've gone through a couple of off-brand chargers that seemed to break after a year of use that cost a few bucks more than this one.  If you are looking for a good charger for your Motorola-branded phone or anything else that charges via a micro-usb like my Kindle Fire, I would recommend this one.3/18/14 Update:The above review was written after using the charger for about two weeks.  After a longer period of time, while my comments on the durability / construction of the charger remain valid, the power output is pretty minimal and I am changing my rating from a 4 star to a 3 star: charging my Motorola phone takes a heck of a long time if the power level is less than 50% and, for example, when it isdown to 20% and plugged in during a two-hour drive, it consistently never gets above 50% charged.","3.0","Well-Constructed Charger But Not Much Power","1390867200","01 28, 2014"

I've bought several different type of generic knock off chargers in the past.  Some that did work, but broke easily, and some that were so poorly made that they wouldn't charge my phone at all.  This Motorola made charger does a great job of charging my phone.  Even if I am streaming music via Bluetooth to my car and using my phone as a GPS, the charger is still able to overcome the power drain and keep the battery charging.  If I had to make one nitpick its the bright blue logo that is lit up while its plugged in.  Its not overpoweringly bright, but its unnecessary in my opinion.

It worked great and charged my phone pretty quickly, even while using GPS and streaming music. I think that this device puts out about 950 mah, which is adequate for most phones.

It bundles the cord a little and helps to keep it out of the way, not by a lot, but a little, and every little bit helps in a car.

A true, blue Motorola brand charger! Plus, at the time of purchase(5/25/11), it was sold and shipped from Amazon. As of today(6/7/11), it is not sold or shipped by Amazon.When I ordered it, it arrived on time, and I tried it right away. It works perfectly. Plus I like the nifty blue logo when it's plugged in. I've seen a couple of reviews saying they received a knock off version when they ordered from the seller I did. Mine was the real thing.

So why should you pay top dollar when you know you'll only get enough use out of it until your next upgrade, generally two years at the most? But if you spend a few minutes doing your research, you'll find this car charger for your Droid Incredible. It's perfect! It has the Motorola branding and the price is about one-fifth what you'd pay at the Verizon store or in a Best Buy.It charges your Incredible pretty quickly. I recently was at 2% battery life. I hooked this charger up, went and did my 35 minute workout at the gym. When I returned to my car, the battery was at a 94% charge. Not bad.The Incredible is a great smart phone. But all of you owners also know that it really sucks up the battery, so it's pretty important that you have a car charger readily available. I highly recommend this one. Not only does it do the job very well, the price is right. You will definitely get your money's worth.","5.0","Great Deal for a Great Price!","1292889600","12 21, 2010"

Easy to remove one end to allow an extended reach.- At first I did not like the underneath cord mount, but it's utility is growing on me. This keeps the cord from getting in the way.- Price: competitive with generic chargers.Cons: the blue light is very bright at night, but it is necessary to be visible during the daytime.

They meet the criteria of low cost, but they usually fail on the important task of working&#34; every time.  This costs $2-$3 more than the cheapo models I've tried, but it works everytime, with every device and continues to work for more than a few months.I've used this in many different cars (some with notoriously troubled cig lighters like my buddy's BMW), and it always seems to work.  I like the &#34;lighted&#34; ring at the end that let's you know in all but the brightest light if it's working.  I also like that it put's out enough power to charge my phone while at the same time using the phone to stream music in my car.  Lastly, I like that it works with all of the devices I've tried it with (Samsung S3, Droid 2, Samsung Mobile Hotspot, and a few friends have charged their devices too).The first one I bought worked so well, I went back and bought a couple more to keep in each of the family cars.

"A3VS7IZZVC6337","B000S5Q9CA","Ted Pavlic","[1, 1]","Note that I purchased this charger directly from Amazon and not from one of the other shippers. After being pleased with the first one, I tried to purchase 2 more, but Amazon limited me to 1. I purchased the third charger from another shipper, and I worry that it won't be authentic.I received this charger in a baggie containing a statement of Motorola warranty. On the underside of the charger, the input/output electrical specifications were given in Spanish. So I think this product comes from a Spanish Motorola inventory. The electrical specifications clearly state an output current of 950mA at 4.75--5.25V. There is a plastic clip (visible in the picture) on onside of the coil that lets the coil fold in two. That helps keep cable management clean in the car.On my way to work this morning, with my HTC Rezound smartphone initially charged to 90%, I turned on navigation and left the screen on. The sun was out, and so the phone became warm in its windshield mount. Nonetheless, I arrived at work with the phone at 94% and starting to pulse its current draw to reduce incoming current. So the charger did its job nicely.So I am very happy with this charger. For under $6, it's a high-rate charger from a recognizable source.The low price and the fact that Amazon limits the number a single buyer can purchase makes me think that this charger will soon not be available for sale. Get it while you can. Nice unit (if you get the real version from Moto). Hopefully it lasts for a while.SIDE NOTE: If you are looking for a dual-output charger suitable for tablets, I also have recently tried the Mediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger (3.1 Amp) and was pretty pleased with it. I didn't try it with tablets, but it performed the same test as above with the same results (if not better), and so I'm pretty confident it really will deliver the 3.1A it promises if necessary (and certainly the 2.1A needed for a single tablet plugged in).","5.0","Nice charger.

The headsets don't work for me. I previously owned a Parrot Minikit, which worked reasonably well for over 3 years, then suddenly died -- although it was working, sound could be neither transmitted or heard through it's speaker. I purchased this unit after reading consistently positive reviews, and got a killer price for an open box unit. Here's my thoughts: the sound quality is better than the Parrot on both ends. The Parrot has better volume with the built-in speaker, but using the T505 over my car stereo is totally awesome. The battery life seems to be pretty good. I'm going right now on my 2nd week without a charge using it daily. Pairing is easy. The auto-pairing when powered off and on works quickly and without a hitch. The text-to-speech voice dialing, which is really a function of the phone not the T505, is OK (I'm using an LG Env2). I usually dial out on the phone, and receive calls using the T505. The control layout is pretty good, and the indicator lights are actually useful. The manual is surprisingly well written.

My wife and son love the music player aspect of the phone, but the quality of the music is not great coming out of the phone itself.Come Valentine's day, I was in the same boat again of not knowing what she would want.  I had already spent time on Verizon's web site thinking that I could find an accessory that she may want and stumbled across this.  After some time researching what this device was capable of - stereo bluetooth through your car stereo as well as utilizing the car stereo for mobile calls I thought that this would be not only cool but a safe way for my wife to talk on the phone while commuting.  A few searches later and I found a price that I could agree with and ordered.Upon receipt on the device, I was impressed with the packaging and the prompt service of the vendor and couldn't wait for my wife to open it up.  When she did, she was able to connect the phone to the device and start playing music through the stereo within minutes of getting to the car.  We also were able to figure out the answering a call and were pleasantly impressed with the quality of the call on both the receiving and sending ends.My qualm is that multiple devices can't be hooked up to it at once, at least we haven't figured it out yet.

"A38FPHYE72Y25P","B000SAD7RA","bigbluelou","[10, 10]","I'm a grizzled veteran of the BT headset wars, and I'm always changing to find the perfect headset.  This is the closest I've come so far.Here's the good:===========================* By far, the best thing about it is the noise-cancelling feature. I'm on the road a lot, and the max setting almost eliminates road and background noise on the other end...my daughter said she hated talking to me when I was on the road before I bought this headset. This is a MAJOR plus, and the main reason I bought it to begin with. It simply works!* Volume is LOUD! In those noisy environments, this is a plus, and I usually have to turn it down to mid-range, even in noisy areas.* Unlike some, it is very comfortable to me, for long periods of time, and I wear mine for hours at a time. Lighweight and small...compared to my Motorola H700, it's heaven. I forget it's even on sometimes.* I love the quick disconnect, reconnect feature using the volume up/down buttons.  I use it with two phones (Motorola V325 for work and Blackberry 8700c for personal), and this makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other without having to fumble through the phone menus. (If you use it with a Blackberry, be sure to turn off the Echo Control setting in the BT menu for this headset.)* Clip for your shirt or pocket.* The price is very reasonable for a headset with these advanced features.So, what kept it from being 5-stars?=====================================* Proprietary charger (why not mini-USB, except to make more money?)* Slippery plastic ear hook, though they do include extras.* Talk time is okay, but not great. I can get maybe 4-5 hours out of it, putting it squarely in the average range based on my experiences.But these are minor, nitpicking complaints.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a small, lightweight, comfortable, noise-reducing headset.","4.0","Best BT Headset I've used so far...and I've used a LOT","1205193600","03 11, 2008"
"A2PL4KZQJ0VFOB","B000SAD7RA","D. Dell Dell","[47, 47]","I have tried almost every brand of Bluetooth Headset on the market, but have not found one that meets my requirements until now. The Blueant Z9 is extremely lightweight and small. This makes it very comfortable, feels secure and does not flop around. The sound is loud enough that you do not have to increase the volume. The voice quality is clear and consistent. I have it paired with a Nokia 6555.Now for some details. The Jawbone is by far the best for handling noise cancellation. However, the voice would sometimes be garbled or breakup. The Z9 does a good job on noise cancellation and the voice stays clear and does not breakup.There are three buttons. The function button handles most features. There are two volume buttons for up and down. The volume buttons also have functions such as holding down the volume up button for three seconds actives the redial feature. This may sound confusing, but it really is not. You just need to read the instructions. The buttons are easy to press with little resistance.The Z9 has a large speaker so there was no need in the design for an ear bud that directs the sound into the ear. It also has two microphones that help improve voice quality for the person you are talking too.The noise cancellation defaults at minimum. In noisy environments, simply click the function button. A voice tells you that it is set to maximum noise cancellation. That is really a cool feature because you do not have to figure out what the beeps mean.The range is as advertised. I walked away from my phone by about thirty feet and still had a clear connection. Therefore, you do not have to place the headset on the same side or close to your phone.I looked at my phones paired devices and noticed I had firmware version 3.1. I went to the Blueant site and downloaded the instructions and installation program for firmware version 3.4. I could not get the installation to work, so I called tech support. He told me that the instructions online were for Windows XP and I had Vista. He said that they have not posted the instructions for Vista online yet. He promptly emailed me the Vista instructions. They were detailed and precise. I upgraded the firmware within a few minutes without any problem.Helpful hint: To get the best sound qualities, speak in a normal voice, not too loud. In addition, update the firmware to the latest version.I highly recommend you try this headset for yourself.Update: I have read that the ear hook is made of stiff plastic that cannot be bent. This is not entirely true. If you want a tighter and more secure fit then do the following. While holding the hook in the bent position you want, hold a hot hairdryer about two inches from it for about five seconds. The hook will stay in that bent position. Just be careful not to bend it too far or the hairdryer is too hot or too close to the hook. I did this with my hook and it fits much better, even with my glasses on.","5.0","Excellent Headset","1201737600","01 31, 2008"

I've already done it (with a few hiccups but BlueAnt's technical support is superb).I was at the Seahawks game and talked with my wife on the headset - she could hear me clearly (although it was so noisy I had a difficult time hearing her). I switched it to voice isolation max while I was pulling some noisy toters over rough asphalt while speaking with a friend and was told that my voice was totally clear.Here's the clincher - shortly after I got the BlueAnt I was speaking with one of my consultants.

"A3C2CPTCMB7S4N","B000SAD7RA","P. Lio Dermatophile","[9, 9]","I've been using a cellphone for a long time and have used lots of corded headsets with varying results.  I had a few bad experiences with Bluetooth early on and felt that it just wasn't ready for the prime time.  A friend got an older Jabra headset and it was terrible to talk on--static, breaking up, muddy speech--I basically REFUSED to talk to him while using it.So it was not without trepidation that I pulled trigger on this little fella.  I am impressed!  The highest praise I can give is to say: IT. JUST. WORKS.  You take it out, charge it and pair it with your phone (Palm Centro, no problem at all).  In seconds I was using it and it sounded GREAT.  Both my wife (an occasional Luddite) and good friend said that it was actually BETTER than when I was talking on the handset regularly.  What more can you say?Very comfortable to wear, the buttons are easy and intuitive to press, and it seems sturdy (in part because it is so light, I dropped it but was not worried at all).  Yes, it is a little confusing to know when to click a button and when to hold a button for 3 seconds and which combinations you need to press, but for the basic functions it's pretty straightforward and only for fancier things do you need to memorize (or look up in the handy guide) the buttons to press.What about background noise?  It did a nice job on a windy Boston day and when you which to maximum voice isolation it does a remarkable job with cutting out background noise and music.In sum, this is a remarkable headset.  It is small, light, affordable, and really does the job.  With a 2 year warranty and upgradable firmware (mine came with 3.4 the newest available), I'd say it is a pretty sweet device and worth picking up.","5.0","It just works = Highest Praise for such a device!","1207008000","04 1, 2008"

I use a cell phone in my home office all day, and I need a headset that sounds very natural and as close to a land line sound as possible. This one delivers that, with very clear sound on both ends.  It's also the lightest one I've used, and it's very easy to wear it all day without discomfort. It also doesn't drop connections with the phone (a blackberry).  I've used a jawbone (sounds like it's a shortwave radio transmission), nokia bh-900 (clear but very uncomfortable for all day use), and a half dozen others in the last few years, and the others don't come close.  I also like that it comes with additional ear loops, but I doubt I'll need them since the earloop seems sturdier that the little wire loops most headsets come with, and I won't be carrying it in my pocket due to discomfort.Buy this one, you'll love it.","5.0","Best headset I've used","1212364800","06 2, 2008"

It is better than all the others I tried, both in fit and sound quality.If you have a high need for switching between multiple devices, however, be aware that the advertised on the fly switching between up to 3 devices does not really work very well.The major shortcoming is that you have to completely turn off the current device (or its bluetooth radio) before you can switch to another device.  This makes no sense at all, since the Z9 has a button control for disconnecting from current device.Depending on your setup, this can range from a nuisance to a major roadblock.  For example, my setup is to use the Z9 with my laptop for Skype calls and my Blackberry for other calls.  I may switch back and forth regularly, depending on who I am calling.If I want to switch from cell phone to laptop, I have to complete turn off the cell phone bluetooth radio, which means the Blackberry loses all of its blutooth connections (including bluetooth synching to PC and modem use).  If I want to switch from laptop to Blackberry, I have to either turn off my entire laptop (it doesn't have a bluetooth radio off option), or remove the Z9 device from the bluetooth profile completely, which means I have to reinstall it from scratch again the next time.There is a new version called the Z9i, which claims to have better/more options for multiple devices.  I don't know if this limitation about having to turn off the current device has been fixed, however.","4.0","Great headset, doesn't work well for multiple devices","1230422400","12 28, 2008"

I have not found a single one my my rechargable electronics for which there is no callpod adapter. I felt that the default adapter's included with the callpod were not the best choice. So before purchasing a callpod make sure you count the cost of all of the spokes that you will purchase; they usually will cost you between seven and ten bucks apiece. But for me that is worth it. So this version of the callpod allowing you to purchase just the base and then purchase adapter's separately is the best route to go in my opinion.My life is a tangle of cords and the callpod chargepod works to fix that. I keep my six devices (usually two blackberries, an ipod, two bluetooth headsets, and an Amazon Kindle) charging in a self-contained circle without cords going everywhere and without the use of a powerstrip. Then when I travel, I can connect those same device to the car charger using the car power adapter. And in a hotel room, I can charge all my devices (including any that charge via usb using the usb adapter) without bringing tons of cords.

They have been fantastic for 11 months until I began to wear them while exercising 3 weeks ago and found that despite their claim of being moisture and sweat resistant they don't appear the be able to handle sweat much at all. My head and neck get damp during exercise (not dripping) and it somehow seeped into the controls and the vol down and rewind buttons stopped working. Also while exercising the headphones initiated a phone call on my cell phone (there is a button on them for that).Before this problem they were fantastic.

The traditional, round, style have better sound but fill with sweat when working out. Literally fill - have to drain them every 15 minutes or so. The open style does not have this problem, but has poorer sound quality and lets in more ambient noise.Yes, you can only hear the phone calls in the left ear, but that's the communication's standard.  If your phone transmitted it in stereo, it would play in stereo.Basically, make sure you know the phone/mp3 player/whatever the device is standard.

I carry my phone in my front pants pocket and the Bluetooth rarely cuts out while listening to MP3's.  I have an average size head and my ears start to hurt after about a half hour of listening with the stock rubber ear cushions. I have installed the included optional rubber cushions and it is better, but after an hour and a half it still starts to hurt. The back of the unit rests on my collar and the rubbing of the collar against the headphones transmits into the ears.The music is crisp and clear, but weak bass.  I turned up the base on my Razr V3xx, but it does not matter because the speakers do not play any bass.  It works great as a headset, pairs up with the phone instantly and answers calls automatically.  People hear me clearly on the other end. It charges with the phone charger or through a USB port.  Everything is okay except ... weak BASS.Addendum: I found out that if I remove my eye-glasses the base improves.  I guess the glasses keep the headset from forming a good seal.I would now give these 4 stars.","3.0","Where's the Bass","1196985600","12 7, 2007"
"A3NEAETOSXDBOM","B000SZ9I0K","Stephen M. Charme","[39, 41]","My ipod nano's wired headphones annoy me when I exercise, so I wanted to find a wireless alternative. I was a little hesitant about buying these headphones and the ipod adaptor because of some negative reviews, but after using them I was happy to find that I have had no problems. In fact, these work great. The headphones fit comfortably in my ear and are easy to take on and off. The sound quality is better than my ipod headphones and is actually quite good. The touch sensitive controls for volume etc. take a little getting used to, but with a little practice they are easy to operate.I am a runner and have used these headphones both on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors, including very windy days. I have not experienced any loss of signal once the bluetooth connection has been established--and I have run literally hundreds of miles with this headset. It is a real pleasure to listen to my ipod without wires dangling all over me.Please note that the bluetooth connection between the headphones and the ipod does not take place instantly. Turn the headphones on and wait for the solid blue light to come on that indicates that the headphones are in bluetooth mode. Then (1) turn on the ipod, (2) insert the adaptor (Note: inserting the adaptor before turning on the ipod did not permit a bluetooth connection to be established), (3) select the first song, and (4) hit the play button on the ipod. There is usually a delay of 10-40 seconds before the headphones make a bluetooth connection with the ipod. Not a big deal. I just restart the song from the beginning.Making a bluetooth connection with my Samsung u-740 cell phone was a snap, and answering calls on the headphones was easy. I had no problem with sound quality.Before purchasing these headphones and adaptor, you should keep some things in mind.First, in order to insert the adaptor into the opening on the bottom of the ipod, either your ipod must be out of the case or you need a case that will give access. I use the latest Contour clear case, which does not permit a completely snug fit(due to two small plastic tabs around the earphone hole; you can remove these if you want), but snug enough so that a bluetooth connection can be established and the adaptor is in tight enough so that I don't worry about it falling out, and in fact it hasn't happened even when I run over rough terrain in the park. I bought an armband intended for the ipod shuffle, and use the belt clip on my Contour case to clip my ipod and inserted adaptor to the armband when I run. Everything is nice and secure.Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headphones on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headphones did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headphones on first.Third, since the headphones are curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headphones, which will come slightly out of their position in your ears. So wearing the headphones with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headphones as the collar pushes against them. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use these headphones comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane).Fifth, because the bluetooth adaptor goes into the socket that is used for charging, there is no way to use the adaptor and charge your ipod at the same time, as you can do using earbuds. Therefore for a long car or plane ride you are better off using your earbuds or some other headset.So don't throw away your ipod earbuds or over-the-ear headsets, but do enjoy this unit in those situations where the limitations I described above don't matter.All in all I am very satisfied with this product. If you are looking for a wireless solution, albeit not a perfect one, this is it.Update Nov. 10, 2008: I have now been using this product for one year and have been very satisfied with its performance. However, I am now on my third pair.Shortly before Labor Day, the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement set of headphones. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.I started going to a new gym this fall, and it tends to very humid where the treadmills are. A couple of nights ago I was drenched in sweat and so were the headphones. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the earbuds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be zapped by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that these headphones are not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my new gym. Now that I know about the problem, I will just wipe them periodically before the sweat really builds up.","5.0","Excellent bluetooth headset for ipod","1196812800","12 5, 2007"

"APGPEJS55U2SF","B000T1RU3A","Jeffrey Liss","[12, 15]","This headset works great on my Nokia 6300b cell phone. I bought it primarily to listen to music on my mobile phone without wires. The sound quality is great here with good bass.Pairing was simple. Just press the control button on the Cardo S-2 for about 7 seconds till you get alternating red and blue flashing lights and then go to your cell phone and add a new bluetooth device (make sure its in discoverable mode) with the 4 digit, 0000 passcode. Since my Nokia also supports the AVRCP profile, I'm able to control all the functions of the music player through pressing different parts of the Cardo S-2 headset. Moreover, the headset is very comfortable to wear, which is quite important.To get the stereo headset to work, I first press the control button on the S-2 for about 3 seconds till I see blue flashing lights. Then I go to the bluetooth section on my cell phone and connect it to the Cardo S-2. Now I can open the music player and listen to beautiful music.This headset comes with a hidden microphone. I've used it for voice conversations with my Nokia and it performs quite well. What's most impressive is that it easily switches from stereo to regular voice calling  seamlessly. I hear everyone well and they hear me well too.I paired the Cardo S-2 with my Fujitsu laptop, running XP Professional SP1, with the Widcomm software, version 4.1 and couldn't get it to work with Realplayer or Windows Media Player at all. I then tried version 5.1, but the result was not much better:  just a few sporadic sounds came out. However, when I paired it with the BlueSoleil software version 1.64, I got these headphones to work on my laptop. The music quality was good (but not as good as on my Nokia), but there were breaks once in a while in the music, which I never had with my Nokia 6300b. However, when I tried the software version 3.2 (Bluesoleil), the sound quality of the music was perfect with no gaps. The only remaining problem I had was that MSN Messenger and Yahoo Instant Messenger did not recognize the microphone on my Cardo S-2 (like my Nokia does). When I emailed Cardo's tech support and told them about this problem, I got this abstract robotic response blaming Microsoft's drivers. But I remedied that by buying the tiny $5 Labtec Mic 333 and plugging it into the microphone jack of my laptop's sound card.I bought the Cardo S2 to use primarily with my Nokia so I am very happy with it. With my Nokia 6300b, the Cardo S-2 deserves 5 stars. With my Fujitsu laptop, I only give it 4 stars because I could not get the Cardo S2 microphone to work with Yahoo Instant Messenger or MSN Messenger.","5.0","Great For Certain Cell Phones","1187913600","08 24, 2007"

I have a car that has an audio input jack for .mp3 players, including iPod. With this cable, I have no problem and need no adapter to hear the music on my iPhone, and when I get an incoming call, the music dims to silence and I can answer via my bluetooth headset or just pick up the phone.While it might make sense for home stereo use, who needs 6 feet of this cable for use in your car? There is so much extra cable, it's silly. I have a 'panic bar' above the glove box, so I have wound the extra length of cable here... to keep it from hanging low where a passenger could accidentally yank it w/ their foot, potentially damaging the audio jack, cable or the iPhone itself.I suppose the length of cable is supposed to make you feel better for having spent this much on a cable. The ends are nice quality and pretty sturdy and the thick cable is nicely insulated, less likely to have interference from crimping.My less than perfect rating is that there should be an option for shorter lengths - or at least it should come with a winding system.","4.0","A Tad Long for Auto Use","1186099200","08 3, 2007"

"A282RNKOO2P5RT","B000TLVMMA","AreYouKidding?","[97, 135]","I received this card when I purchased an unlocked phone. Considering I travel a ton, this was a nice freebie.Pros:- First of all, I have to say that the instructions are very simple to follow. All of my questions were answered by the time I finished reading the two-pager. There is even a great troubleshooting portion at the end.- The rates are about $0.05 per minute cheaper than AT&T;, but ultimately it will depend on which countries you visit.- I love the fact that I now have an International Number for whenever I travel. I just pop the SIM card into my Quad-Band phone and I'm all set!- The card was free with purchase of mySony Ericsson W580i Grey Phone (Unlocked).Cons:- None that I can think of.Helpful tips:- The phone number you are assigned is from the UK. It will start with county code 44. If people are going to call you from the US, they need to dial 011 44 and then the unique number Mobal assigns you.- Mobal provides a SIM PIN if you wish to lock you phone. It's not required, but it will prevent unwanted use if you happen to lose your phone.- The worldwide emergency number is 112. Works just like 911 in the states.- You have to go to special SIM activations site (Amazon wont let me post the actual URL) to activate the SIM card. Once there you need to enter in your SIM card serial number and the phone number that Mobal assigns you. These numbers are all found in the upper-right hand portion of the instruction sheet. This site is also where you register and enter your credit card information.","5.0","A great deal and a great idea for those who travel abroad..","1188259200","08 28, 2007"

"A3KO6JEVS1FJ8X","B000TLVMMA","Little Tank LT","[45, 46]","Read the other reviews carefully. Those ranking it high may not be well-informed about all options -and there ARE comparatively INEXPENSIVE, easily available options!You'll need an unlocked quad-band phone (available in all price ranges - sometimes buying one at destination can be competitive re price but not always) plus your own regular service SIM, pre-authorized for international use (call your carrier before you go) to use just in case until you decide which service to use wherever you're headed. Even at a dollar or two per min for a just in case call, YOUR OWN service will, for those few calls until you get a local SIM, be cheaper. (Or you can always text-message/SMS, cheaper YET, even on your own SIM!) Also pack a good pre-paid international phone card, too, as back-up (amt depending how long you'll be gone and how many countries you're jaunting off to - you can recharge this, too) so you can call home from something other than your cell (which can also get pricy).On arrival, purchase a local-provider SIM w/appropriate features for you  (kiosks, local cell ph provider stores), and add some initial funds to it. Install or ask them to do so. Then buy pre-paid recharge cards as needed; not high-priced. I found them even in E Europe (every country) and Turkey - yes, higher per min than a contract, but a TINY percentage of the cost of Mobal or your own cell ph! Take a few minutes on-line and explore regarding this - you will be very glad you did.I hope Amazon withdraws this from their offerings, I truly do.","1.0","ZERO stars - AVOID!!!","1236643200","03 10, 2009"

I frequently travel internationally and need short-term access to international roaming, which my old cell provider did not offer and my new one charges a monthly fee for. I put this in my phone when I am out of the country and it has been very useful. When I expect high use or an extended stay I buy a separate sim card from a local provider in the country, but for occasional use I use this. The per-minute usage charges are very high, but if you consider the cost of a sim card for each country, this plan is still a good idea for low use. I have also used it for backup when my pre-paid sim card unexpectedly ran out of funds on my last trip ($%^ kids!).I have had good reception; it has worked wherever there was any cell reception.Make sure your phone has a sim card, is unlocked, and that the frequency will work where you are headed.

"A1GBYLTE2PRS31","B000TLVMMA","Shane Conder","[7, 15]","We used a Mobal Sat phone when traveling around the world a couple of years back.  Mobal has absolutely _wonderful_ customer service.  Our initial research had shown that we'd be in places without GSM coverage.  Our friends with a UK phone proved us otherwise -- who knew out back in the Masai Mara a GSM phone would work?  The peace of mind was great, though.Now, when this Mobal SIM card was offered up for free with my N95 purchase, I jumped on it.  How could I pass up a free phone number, free incoming SMS virtually everywhere, and a card that doesn't charge any fees at all?  With this SIM card around, I don't have to think about it.  I can just pop it in and go.  No need to learn a new number, no need to find out what SIM card actually has good rates, etc.Compare this to a buddy who picked up a SIM card to be in France for a month.  The card itself was cheap (maybe $20 -- although that's $10 more than this one).  However, the fine print and extra fees ended up making the whole ordeal cost about $1500 for just a couple of hours of use.  This car in France? Only $150 to call back to the US - and no fussing around. If you'd just roamed with AT&T;: $155 plus fees. And back at the Masai Mara for two hours? AT&T;: $478 Mobal: $234.  No guarantees that a local prepaid SIM wouldn't charge huge rates for international calling, either.If that still sounds expensive, just remember that there are no other fees and it's your phone number.  Additionally, remember that you'll not be yacking on the phone like you do back home (you're traveling -- see the sites!)  Even my 2 hour example is excessive for us; we rarely talk more than a couple of minutes when really traveling to get away.This card is highly recommended, especially if you can get it bundled.","5.0","A better deal than the rates imply","1209340800","04 28, 2008"
